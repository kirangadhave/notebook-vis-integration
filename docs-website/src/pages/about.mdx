## Acknowledgements

The widget architecture of Persist is created using [anywidget](https://github.com/manzt/anywidget) projects.

The interactive visualizations used by Persist are based on the excellent, [Vega-Lite](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite) and [Vega-Altair](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair) projects. Specifically the implementation of [JupyterChart](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/blob/main/altair/jupyter/jupyter_chart.py) class in Vega-Altair was of great help in understanding how Vega-Altair chart can be turned into a widget.
