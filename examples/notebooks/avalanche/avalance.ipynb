        "Comments 1": "Two of us started up at about 10:00 and saw only one other group headed up toward Cardiff (and a few near the bottom working on a kicker.)Knowing the danger was still high per UAC, we decided to hike up Flagstaff Shoulder and ski down the Flagstaff Shoulder staying along the ridge. after reaching False Flag summit, we did a ski cut under the ridge to test the wind affected snow. Nothing went but that didn't change our plans. Both of us took turns skiing down favoring just east of the ridge in soft snow. Small cornices had formed on the east side of the ridge partway down - we avoided them. After re-grouping at about the 9500' elevation, Skier 1 started down a small section of steeper angle just east of the ridge and it immediately broke on a wind-loaded rollover section with the initial crown about 50' in length 5' behind skier. Skier 2 immediately yelled to notify and the triggering skier and Skier 1 angled back to the top of the ridge to avoid the avalanche. The slide propagated to about 75-100 ft wide and ran down hitting a roller and continuing over to run a total of about 800 ft. We had seen no one else in the area above or below us. We worked our way down to the base to observe.\n\nWarm temperatures. Flat light. Overcast. Slight wind (more up top.)\n",

        "Comments 1": "Party of four. Skinned up Emmas approx 9:30 am. Skied Hideway, small slow push-avalanches witnessed with short running lengths. Heavy wet snow coming down all day. Many discussions about safe travel and safe protocols. Also winds from last night were a hot topic.  Established skinner up ridge separating Main Days and Upper days with the objective of skiing Main Days. At the top skiing tactics were discussed. Skier 1 ski cut across small gully to a sub ridge with a small stand of trees. Skier 2 cut just above tracks to spot next to him. Skier 3 cut higher still and crossed a steeper section close to the main ridge. He triggered a wind slab that propagated up to the main ridge. Avalanche triggered up slope approx 8 feet. I yelled out a warning. Skier 1 was \"sat down\" Skier 2 carried 10 feet. Skier 3 carried 20 feet. No burials everyone self arrested on the hard bed surface. Out of my sight (Skier 4 still on main ridge) the avalanche crown ran approx 700 feet plus along the main ridge to the west. As the slide ran it stepped down into the old wet snow and ran into the gully. Entraining old wet snow the slide ran to the valley floor. Skiers 1,2,3 started to search the debris field. Made contact with a solo split boarder skinning on the main ridge. No signals detected. I stayed up and took pictures. Crown 6 inches to 1.5 feet. Wind loaded it ran on a very distinct crust. Team regrouped at the toe of the debris pile did one more search. Circled up did a debrief and went back to the car.\n\nLessons:\n\nSafe travel protocols were instrumental today. \n\nOur ski cuts (1 and 3) could have been better\n\nWe expected the ski cuts would produce a slide in the little gully. The results exceeded expectations.\n\nThe forecast was 100% correct today The slide Evelyn Lees predicted was the slide that happened\n\n \n",

My camera battery died shortly after getting a photo from the top of circle awl so no detailed debris or crown photos.\n",

        "Comments 1": "Riding conditions in dry fork were incredible on Tuesday, April 16. The top layer of storm snow was a little dense, but still fluffy enough for over the windshield turns all day. After getting our fill on the sleds we made the decision to ski a sub ridge in the center of the drainage below the top of Alta's Supreme lift. The prominent aspect of the face is east, however there are more northerly and southerly pockets. My partner dropped a mid sized cliff into a small, northeasterly facing chute right around 10,000 feet in elevation. When he landed a small slab released and propagated a short distance along the bottom of the cliffs. The crown ranged from 1-2 feet in depth and was approximately 30-40 feet wide. In total the slide ran around 100 feet down the slope before it ran out of steam. We determined the angle of the slope to be 31° - 33° where it released. The pocket that released had most likely been a deposition zone for wind transported snow during the last storm. When loaded by the weight of the snowboarder it easily broke free. The slab showed no evidence of stepping down, failing only in the top layer and running on the harder crust underneath. \n\n \n\n \n",

There were 2 additional avalanches in Hanks Canyon that probably occurred on Saturday night.   This slide ran 2810 ft based on an estimated release point.  When we discovered the slide, it was covered by 5 to 8 inches of new snow.   About 2/3 the way down from the crown, there was a pine tree in the middle of the avalanche path that had limbs broken by the avalanche that were 20 feet above the level of the current snow pack.  The attached picture shows a pine tree on the very edge of the avalanche that shows the depth of the avalanche to be about 12 feet. (Flagging and snow packed against the trunk of the tree.)",

As expected we saw plenty of loose wet action on east facing slopes around 11am, some in the form of small avalanches slowly running a couple hundred feet and some in the form of thousands of snowballs peeling off the rocks at once. On our exit out redpine trees we looked back to pay homage to her majesty and saw a small wind slab Avalanche (likely skier triggered) on NE around 10,000. Other than that, there was powder and the people got some.\n",

        "Comments 1": "Saw a natural avalanche soon after it came rushing down the couloir directly SW of the main summit of Cascade Peak from about 10 miles away on I-15. Originally thought it was a fog cloud until I saw it picking up speed and rushing out of the bottom. I am assuming that it broke off near the summit where there would be significant windloading. The couloir to the flats is 4000ft and it ran that and likely another 500ft through the meadows by. I would not be surprised if we can find flattened trees down at the bottom later this year. The tail end of it likely blew by the hope campground or it may have even spilled up into it a bit. I am assuming that no one was in that slide path or in the run out on a day like today with the heightened avalanche risk. The crown was likely a few hundred feet wide and a few feet deep based off of the visibility of the slide from ~10 miles away.\n",

        "Comments 1": "I and my party of 3 others poked around Main Days, noticing firm wind slabs immediately off the ridge, but no amount of stomping from the top could get them to move. Since the snow was visibly softer and the slope mellows fairly quickly here, we decided we could manage this and still ski Main Days. We all skied the first run without an issue. We did notice cracking from the storm slab and we had small slabs release in a few steeper sections near the waterfall exit. Not enough to bury someone, and with a clean run out, we decided to go up for another lap and choose even mellower lines with forgiving run outs. \nOn the second lap, I cut further to the left where the slope was fairly mellow and I wasn't worried about anything breaking above me. However, the slope rolled over to about 38 degrees for a small section and as soon as I hit it the slope broke all around me. Interestingly, the snow was so soft I didn't feel a thing(in fact I didn't even know it was happening and kept skiing normally for probably 6-8 turns until I heard one of my partners yelling and I looked back and saw the snow chasing me and the crown where I had skied. I cut out to the left of the run out and all was fine. \nSince Main Days has only a few relatively short steep sections that have a real likelihood of sliding, we felt that we had a manageable avalanche problem. With how much cracking and small slabs we were popping out, I would say the old snow surface is bonding rather poorly, it might have started faceting a bit during this quieter period of weather, something to pay attention to the next few weeks.\n",

We didn't trust the unreleased snow above the debris, so did not search further. We did not see or hear anyone at the top of the slope either, so we moved on.\n\n \n\nOur best guess was a natural cornice fail with the new load and some daytime warming, which then released the storm slab on the graupel layer. I checked the snowpack nearby and found about 16\" of new snow on top of a very thin crust on top of well preserved graupel. The graupel likely pooled under these cliffs as well, making it even more reactive here.\n\n \n\n[Forecaster Comment: Seeing an avalanche and then performing a beacon check is a great example of looking out for one another in the backcountry. Thank you!]\n",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "Four experienced local snowmobilers were riding in the “Rodeo Grounds” area on Christmas Eve morning, the first clear day after several consecutive days under stormy weather conditions. The party triggered a huge hard slab avalanche, which buried and killed two close friends, 22-year-old Erik Jorgensen of Paradise and 23-year-old Jesse Johnson of Hyrum. \nThe avalanche was reported to authorities at around 10:30 am via satellite phone by a member of a separate snowmobiling party. About twenty snowmobilers, who were riding in the area, helped the surviving members of the party with the rescue attempt. From what I could piece together at the scene, one of the victims was very deeply buried in the heavy debris (10-12’ deep). The other was recovered in the vicinity of a grove of large spruce and fir trees. Survival of such a deep burial in avalanche deposition is extremely rare, and trauma due to impacting trees while carried by an avalanche accounts for around 25% of avalanche deaths in North America.\nThe victims were recovered with the aid of avalanche transceivers, which each wore, and probes and shovels. After previous avalanche incidents in the area, extra probes and shovels are cached at a nearby warming hut by Cache Search and Rescue (Cache County Sheriff) and local snowmobilers…. Members of CSAR and the flight crew of the responding Life Flight medical rescue helicopter were unable to resuscitate the two young men.",

        "Comments 1": "          Disappointed to report another unintentional skier triggered avalanche today in Mineral Fork, BCC on Mongo No. Could either be a soft slab (SS) or hard slab (HS) I can not come to a conclusion for sure. While it did have some blocky avalanche debris, I cannot confirm that the slab was 1F or harder.  I will call it a SS-ASu-R2-D2 that failed on what appeared to be 1.5mm facets on a North aspect at about 10k. Around 100ft wide, ran about 700ft and the crown depth was up to 3ft. Due to it breaking into old faceted snow we believe it was a Persistent Slab. \n\n\n          On the drive to LCC we made persistent slabs our number one concern today in the terrain we were traveling. We looked past a number of warning signs. These included finding a thin rocky snowpack on the entrance (facets), the fact that Mongo No had already slid this year, and seeing many avalanches on similar aspects and elevations. (Although we categorized those as storm/wind slabs that likely lost the energy by today.) We counted eight avalanches just from our view from the top of Mongo No. Just that alone should have kept us on more conservative terrain. We though that the structure was better than it was, and that there was less energy in the snowpack. We were wrong, the structure in that spot and I assume in many other rocky areas in Mineral was weaker than we figured.  This was also our third run of the day and I feel we had too much confidence brewing. Triggered from the skiers right flank of the slide.  \n\n          I was able to ski off the slab and out of harms way but the side was in unforgiving terrain and I was lucky. Booted up and out of that terrain and went down a lower angle slope that had a fatter and stronger snowpack where we stayed the rest of the day. Credit goes to UAC for the accurate forecast of persistent slab problem on high east aspects for the morning of 3/4/15. ​\n",

        "Comments 1": "We toured from Alta up and over into Cardiff and then into Mineral finishing in BCC. Winds were moderate gusting to strong above treeline in alpine zones all day, with winds ramping up in the afternoon around 1 pm as the front moved in and skies transitioned from clear to mostly cloudy. Winds were southerly and transporting snow onto northerly aspects, cross loading a lot of E and W facing terrain.  In the afternoon on our exit, winds picked up considerably, and cross loaded mid elevations resulting in touchy wind slabs on anything that was exposed out of the trees with a northerly tilt. Ski cuts in Room of Doom produced a small wind slab breaking at our feet ~4-7\" deep. Once we got into the mid elevations (9100'-9400') we remote triggered a small wind slab avalanche above us (4-6\" deep) on a WNW aspect. Descending the mineral gully we ski cut the NE gully sidewalls triggering a 4-8\" deep wind slab that propagated and traveled a decent ways down the gully. I believe these soft sensitive wind slabs were failing on lightly faceted snow. \n\n \n\nAbove treeline conditions on NW-E aspects were a mixture of firm wind board, wind slab, orange peel (faceted old wind slab) some light breakable wind crust, antitracks, sastrugi, and soft faceted wind pressed powder. E and W aspects were more wind damaged with some good skiing where orange peel was present.  Due N aspects held the best snow with the least wind effect.  Mid elevations in sheltered NW-E aspects held more faceted snow that was quite \"loud\" to ski through. These areas are most suspect for potential PWL reactivity with the next measurable snow fall.  In the am, SW and S held a much firmer breakable MFC. SE held a mixture of soft snow and MFC on SE in the am. Southerly and due W aspects warmed to a damp to wet surface during the day.\n\n \n\nThere is a decent sized glide crack in upper Room of Doom. \n\n \n\nOne other note, there are a lot of redundant and bold skin tracks up the middle of steep runs that are not typical ascent routes across the Wasatch right now. Typical ascent routes are used and repeated because they are more defensive, often more avalanche resistant, and safer, while also having the benefit of saving the best lines of snow to be skied and enjoyed, one at a time (while skiing and riding avy terrain). \n",

Person appeared to be riding down the Dog Lake Chutes and made a cross slope turn and initiated a wide/substantial Dry Loose Avalanche that dug down to the old snow new snow interface upon descent, and was at least 90 feet wide. Tracks rode out of the debris. The debris piled up to be at least 2 feet if not 3 and ran to the transition. Of note the entire rider's right half of the Main Dog Lake Chute had multiple Natural Dry Loose Avalanches that appeared to be initiating from  the steep North facing cliff bands and these also ran to the transitions. Hand Shears and Tilt Tests confirmed the obvious weakness that only got deeper as the day progressed. Snow fall rates were sustained in the S3 to S4 range for the most of the entire day with HN from 0900 exceeding 6 inches, and the HST 14 inches. Snow was extremely light density and there was good bonding to the old snow/new snow interface as the storm came in Rightside up. Still experiencing isolated collapsing, but as visibility was poor most of the day it was difficult to see any other Avalanche Activity. \n",

The largest was the first gully to the\n\nNorth in Dry fork.  There was a shorter 5' Crown fracture about 9300'.  It swept the gully and partly up the sides.\n\nIt dropped to the South and made a turn toward the road.  The last hundred yards it slid as a large pile of big\n\nblocks and balls.  Leaving 15' to 18' on the road then filling 150' or more of the deep gully west of the road.\n\nThe debris was over 90' wide.  It will be tough to get a sled or snow bike across until it softens up.\n\n \n\nIn the next shallow draw to the East there was a damp sluff with a small pile of debris.\n\n \n\nFurther East there is a twofer. At the top  of the ridge there is a large boulder.  There was a release\n\njust below it that split into two with each shallow avalanche following it's own course.  They both\n\ndropped into the Aspens.\n\n \n\nThese were all probably triggered by late morning solar warming.  Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\n \n\nI got a good look up Burnt Hollow.  There were widespread shallow slides.  Point releases and\n\nrollers.  Most of it was Westerly to Southwest aspects. Probably a lot of afternoon heat on Wednesday.\n\n \n\nMost of the cornices to the East and on the NW ridges of Provo Peak are diminished or missing. \n\n \n\nMuch of the pack surface lower has what I assume is percolation matrix. \n\n \n\nA steep slope Southwest of the campground has a pair of glide fractures opening up. \n\n \n",

        "Comments 1": "Went up with intentions of skiing into upper Cardiff via LSB on the East face. East had a crust so noticing all the snow on south facing was good on the way up, decided to ski south face Little Superior out. Did a ski cut from a high to a lower point just off the ridge. Wind slab released that was much bigger than expected. Produced a decent powder cloud on the way down, running approximately 2000 vertical feet. It funneled down through a choke of what I think is called the Two Trees area. I went down skiers left of the slide where snow was not wind effected and ended up skiing through a sizable amount of debris. Would have been a crappy ride if caught in it as lots of rocks now are just under new snow. Definitely enough snow to burry someone. \nGood example of cross loading. West winds loaded snow east of the ridge (see photo of before the slide) straight in front of my ski tips. Everything between my skis and the ridge cracked out. Sorry...no photos of the slide. Would have been difficult to see anyway. ",

First slide  seemed to be triggered from a natural cornice drop. Not sure of the  specifics in this slide it was quite a long ways away, but it looked to  be a fairly large slide.

        "Comments 1": "I made a bad choice. \n\n \n\nSkier 1 (myself) dropped into the coalpit headwall performing a ski cut to a safe sub-ridge with manageable stuffing that proceeded down the ski line. I then skied the headwall about 1/3 down and stopped skiers right on a sub-ridge dividing two of the lines. Skiers 2 and 3 skied from the top to me then proceeded to continue down to safety towards the bottom.  Prior to skier 3 leaving me we talked that I would go right into the next line. This is my bad choice letting skier 3 leave before I headed into the other line because I became a solo skier at this point not visible to my party. I did a ski cut at the top without any release.  3 turns in I was part of nature and sliding on my side head uphill with snow rushing around me and behind me. I hit rocks with my skies then bounced off one with my hip. I did yell hoping my party could here me but to no avail. I came to a stop about 150 ft down from the initiation point on the bed surface, and watched the toe of the slide proceed another 460 feet below. I was able to stand right up, didn't lose anything, and ski down the soft avalanche debris to my group, on my one good ski, around the cliffs and regroup. Broke a ski, bruised a hip, and am lucky.\n\n \n\nSoft slab that broke at my feet but knocked me down in the process.  Couldn't tell you how deep. About 35 feet wide and ran about 600 total feet. \n\n \n\nI wasn't going to post anything but here it is. I don't regret where I skied or the slide but I do regret skiing where my partners couldn't watch out for me. If I had been buried they would have had no idea an buy the time they figured it out it likely would have been to late.\n\n \n\nPlease make better choices than I did.\n",

        "Comments 1": "Thanks Bill, Lee and Ron for the heads up on this large avalanche cycle so I could get some photos from across the valley today. I may not have spotted them otherwise. \n \n\nPhotos below show a widespread natural avalanche cycle that occurred on the east side of Chilly Peak, the Chilly Peak slabs, and Zero G Chute. I did my best to try and outline the most prominent crowns and debris toes.  But there are too many to show them all. It appears some ran earlier in the storm, as they appear to be covered with new snow. Zero G appears to have ran late in the cycle as the debris looks crisper and fresher. I'm guessing that the slides ran on the new/old Snow interface. But it's possible it ran with the density inversion combined with high PI rates.  Looks like Zero G ran about 1800 to 2000 foot vertical, likely not stopping not too far above the groomed cross country trails. \n",

        "Comments 1": "\n\nI will start off by saying this has taken me a week to write. I wasn't sure what to say or even if I should share this with anyone. After thinking that this could be a valuable learning experience for someone, I decided to submit my avalanche report, so here goes...\n\n \n\nStairs Gulch. We all know the danger that exists there, yet we still go play there.\n\n \n\nOn May 9, 2023 I headed up Big Cottonwood Canyon and parked across from the Storm Mountain Amphitheater. The big slide that happened in Stairs Gulch on May 3, I had to go see it. I grabbed my pack and I started recording my route on Gaia GPS at 5:36 pm and made the short walk up the trail, reaching the slide path in minutes. It was huge. I snapped a few photos and decided I wanted to see more, so I strapped my snowshoes on and started to venture up the avalanche path.\n\n \n\nNow, before I go any further, I was well aware of what I was doing. I accepted the risk as soon as I made the choice to put those snowshoes on and start walking up that avalanche path. I consider myself to be very experienced with all the time I have spent in these mountains over the years, mostly as solo hiker, peakbagger and snowshoer. When it comes to avalanches, I know a little but still have a lot to learn. I have never put myself purposely in avalanche danger, until May 9, 2023.\n\n \n\nThat big slide from May 3 really made a mess in that gulch as I rounded the first bend. Huge blocks of snow everywhere with big trenches from different sized slides recently. Snow had piled up where slides had stopped. 20 feet maybe more. I dunno. The left side of the gulch had big snow walls that were taller than me and an extended hiking pole. You could also hear water underneath all that snow. It did not seem like the ideal side to be traveling on so I stuck to the right side. It seemed like easier travel. And why is that? The recent avalanches had created a smooth path to walk on. The angle increased significantly going up the slide around the first bend approaching the second bend, slowing me down. This area as you know, is also one of the shortest wall-to-wall widths in the bottom of the gulch. This area was filled with giant round balls of snow everywhere, making for slow going up this portion. I had contemplated just scrambling up the smalls cliffs on the left side at the second bend, but decided to keep on going around the bend. By this time, it was approaching 6:30 pm. I still had sufficient daylight remaining. However, rounding this bend, the terrain got harder to travel on. There was chunks of snow everywhere and was clear this portion of the gulch had been battered with avalanches as it had ran up both sides of the wall at least 10 feet. I chose to continue up the right side as the left side looked like it needed some crampons to walk up. I reached another old dirty slide path coming off the cliffs to the south. At this point the gulch has started to widen and the angle eases a great deal. I have now reached what is likely the widest portion of Stairs at around 6600 ft. It was now 6:30 pm. I left the right side of the gulch and made my way to the very center of this huge avalanche. It was now 6:39 pm as I was snapping photos and taking videos. It really was amazing to see all this debris everywhere you looked. 6:48 pm I thought about venturing on up further to the next bend in the gulch and the elevation climb of 1000+ ft. from that point, and the time, deterred me from it. I was at 6700 feet now and it was 6:53 pm. I am still taking photos and looking straight up the gulch towards that west facing wall. I'm smiling and having an alright time, not knowing I would be running for my life in the next 5 minutes. I take another photo at 7:00 pm...\n\n \n\nLittle did I know what I had just taken a photo of. Uh oh. There was a BIG glide avalanche that had broken loose on that west facing wall. We all know that spot that slides every spring, except I did not know it (until now). I didn't hear it at all. I caught a wall of moving snow out of the corner of my eye. I don't know how wide or tall it was. It looked easily twice as tall as I am. I just knew it was coming and I was still in the middle of that avalanche path where I had been snapping photos for 10 minutes. I ran, with snowshoes on, over avalanche debris. I had a choice to make and only seconds to make it. Left or right. I didn't know what way the slide was going. I saw some trees and dry ground and no snow on the left side. I don't know how I made it there, but I did. Had I chose the right, I would have been in the path of this slide.\n\n \n\nIt all happened so fast as I suppose most avalanches do. I think I was in shock from what just happened to me. I had a glide avalanche in Stairs Gulch after a record snowpack year heading straight towards me, and I didn't get buried. I didn't know what to do. That is when I realized that I had made it to safety and at the same time got myself severely tangled in some twisted up tree limbs. I still had my snowshoes on. I could not get free. It was quite the fight to get myself out of those trees that had been twisted by avalanches. I had literally ran into them with those snowshoes almost breaking my left leg. I don't know how I got myself out. And it wasn't even 7:05 yet. This had all happened in a matter of a few minutes. I turned around to catch the end of the avalanche going by. After all this time, it still made very little sound and only sounded like slush sliding by. I had managed to get those snowshoes off and finally out of those trees. I turned and snapped a quick photo at 7:09 pm of the last bit of snow sliding by. I am freaked out now. I sat on a fallen pine tree trying to gather myself. My ribs hurt, my lower body hurt, especially my left leg and knee. Now what do I do? I always carry a PLB with me. Do I call for help and risk putting someone else in danger an hour before sunset? I didn't want to do that. Finally at 7:24 pm, I put those snowshoes back on and took my chances. If I could make it past that second bend and to the first bend, I can make it. Or so I hoped. I took the chance of there not being two glide avalanches happen in the same place at the same time on the same day. I made my way down so slowly and this time I stayed to the (what is now right) opposite side of the gulch that the slide ran down. It was not fun.\n\n \n\nAt 7:57 I had reached the first bend and knew that I had made it. I don't know how, but I made it. I was so, so incredibly lucky on this day. If the state of Utah had a lottery, I'd have stopped and bought a ticket on the way home. I feel like I should not have returned to the car that night, instead being buried under who knows how much snow. Or have taken a ride directly into some cliffs and suffered some serious trauma. That avalanche broke around 9600 feet (I think) and made it down past the second bend and halfway down to the first bend. I don't know the estimates of the size. You can judge the width and length by the photos that I've included.\n\n \n\nSo, what did I learn from this incident? Well, for one, stay out of Stairs Gulch until those avalanches up high finish releasing. I was very fortunate to have only walked away with a swollen knee, massive bruises on my lower legs and a bruised lower rib. None of those are from the avalanche itself and only from me escaping into those trees.\n\n \n\nI am not a good writer and I apologize for my long novel. I imagine this is the longest avalanche observation ever. This took a lot of time for me to type out. Some of it probably makes little to no sense with my explanations. I happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. Had I started earlier, I likely would have continued on higher up, possibly ending up right where the slide broke. Had I started a little later, I may have been approaching that second bend as that slide was coming down it. All my photo stops, and when I started to slow going up that second bend, causing me to takes breaks, is what I believe could have saved me from getting there at the same time when the slide was coming down. Who knows.\n\n \n\nMy only hope in all this is that someone out there reads my story and gains a little knowledge from it.\n\n \n\n\nPhoto 1: Taken at 6:53 pm where I stopped to take photos in the middle of the slide path. Notice the snow is still dirty.\n\n \n\nPhoto 2: Taken at 7:00 pm. You can see see the slide had broken and was on the way towards me. I had no clue at the time.\n\n \n\nPhoto 3: Zoom shot showing the slide. I didn't see that in the photo until the next day.\n\n \n\nPhoto 4: This was where the slide caught my eye coming down towards me.\n\n \n\nPhoto 5: This was at 7:09 pm and was the only photo I got of the slide, which just shows snow.\n\n \n\nPhoto 6-9: Highlighting the beginning and showing the slide path towards the second bend. Notice the areas with white snow.\n\n \n\nPhoto 10-11: Showing time stamps at 6:53 moments before and then 7:00 of the slide breaking.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd to beat it all, I had my GoPro turned on, but not recording, and strapped to my head that entire time. That would have been great footage...\n\n \n\nThank you and stay safe out there.\n\n\n",

        "Comments 1": "Started at the white pine trailhead bright and early at 4:20 a.m. We evaluated the snow on the way up the north side of Red Baldy. Felt fine for the most part, some very minor slabbing on the top surface at the upper ridgeline. Winds up top had started to come by the time we summited, but were still blowing 10g25 W. One of the party had skied steeper South faces the evening before in upper lcc and noted surprisingly good stability, especially right after fresh snowfall and wind, so we were quite surprised by the outcome on this tour. \n\n \n\nOne of us dropped in with an intentional ski cut, to the right, didn't get anything to move, but did not wait and immediately made another ski turn to the left. About 1 to 2 seconds after initiating the left turn, the slab broke. Luckily they were within a couple feet of the edge and were able to cut above it. We were expecting some wind pockets here and there perhaps, but nothing of this width.\n\n \n\nWe skied down over the bed surface of the debris which was still relatively soft and then stuck to the center of the line as that had previously slid and then gotten covered by another layer of fresh snow. Definitely was tempting to slash the deeper powder on the sidewalls, but we were spooked enough and didn't want to risk triggering anything else. There was a lot more wind loading in there then we expected based on experiences from the afternoon prior.\n\n \n\nPhenomenal skiing despite the slide, however, I won't be trusting any steep South aspects away from the usual bombed highway lines, like I normally do. Seems like there's a crust/surface facet interface that we don't typically have and which is already being reported. We should have been more vigilant here on this tour.\n",

        "Comments 1": "We (a party of 5) started up in the morning headed up the west side of Box Elder from the Dry Creek trailhead with the intend of skiing southwest off of the summit and then down through mellow WNW facing aspens. I've done this tour that last 3 or 4 years on New Years day as it is generally safe and has an old road to by pass the scrub oak even in low snow years. However, since we knew of a party skiing the same route yesterday, rather than taking our normal route up, we instead opted to save time following their skin track one ridge further north.\n\nOnce we reached 8000', we were already experiencing quite and bit of wind out of the East and we decided that a summit descent wasn't going to happen and that we'd just go to timberline and ski down through the aspens. The track we followed also was definitely not better than the normal route, so we were moving more slowly than expected. Between us and our descent of choice was a fairly open, slightly brushed WSW slope that yesterday's skin track crossed. Open seeing the slope, I noticed that a gully was being cross loaded and about a hundred feet below the skin track a small (2-4\" by 10') pocket had pulled out. The skin track crossed the gully higher and was safe (there was a smaller 1\" deep pocket above a flat that cracked when I hit it with a pole). We spread out and continued, wary but not too concerned. I had briefly considered putting in a new track up to the ridge to avoid crossing the slope, but didn't say anything (wanting to get out of the wind quickly) and continued across.\n\nA few hundred yards latter, I spotted a couple of obvious pillows. The left was 30' wide by 20' tall, and the right was 40' wide by 20' tall. The track went below the left one with plenty of breathing room both towards the toe of the right pocket. When I tested it with a ski tip, the perimeter of the pocket cracked all the way around but did not slide. Their appeared to be 2\"-10\" deep pencil-hard windslab. On the other side was sheltered, low angle terrain. I stopped and waited for another member of our party to decide what to do, not wanting to cross the pocket that had cracked. We agreed that it would probably be okay to carefully skin between the left and right pockets and then cross over the top of the right-hand pocket were it had cracked out. I started up but by this time the other members of the group had nearly caught up with us and we didn't realize that they had just moved below the left hand pocket.\n\nAfter a couple of narrowly spaced kick turns, the slope above me and the left-hand pocket all slide. Where I was, the slap was only 3-4\" thick and I stayed put (although it packed some punch and I was not certain I was going to stay were I was). The partner I had consulted with was directly below me and also managed to arrest before going anywhere. The pocket to our left, however, turned out to be tucked in under a small rock, allowing the slab to be 2' deep at that point (much to our surprise). The large slab went directly towards the other three members of our party. One managed to get out of the way, another was carried a few feet, but the third was hit directly and carried about 40'. He managed to grab a 3\" aspen which promptly broke off in his hand but slowed him enough for the slide to go by. At the same time, I was able to quickly kick turn and move into the bed surface to maintain visual contact.\n\nAt this point everyone was okay, but the wind was still blowing hard. Three of us retreated to slightly safer ground while another went down to help search for a missing ski. After ten minutes of searching we found nothing and didn't feel comfortable lingering so we retreated minus one ski. One think we noted afterwards was the chaos associated with the slide. While I was ready to dive down and start digging if necessary, the un-caught member of our group didn't know that anyone had taken ride - we would have been wise to take 30 seconds to communicate before taking any action.\n\n \n",

        "Comments 1": "In an attempt to decrease my risk on my last run I skied skiers left of Sound of Music.  I had been skiing big lines all day however they were mostly on snow pack that gets hit by Canyons traffic.  Recently I have been skiing skiers left of Sound of Music because most ski the big open line of Sound of Music which seems to always have tracks now.  So this line rarely gets skied.  The slide occurred about 2 turns off the ridgeline.  When it broke loose I was pretty sure the staunch wall was right in front of me as I saw a wave of snow in front of me but after I passed the stanch wall the lower snow below must have broken loose as well because that was only the beginning.  Luckily the layer below the new snow was a hard slab that did not move.  After riding over 200 feet and almost hooking a small Aspen at the very top (which in hind sight maybe I should have tried to grab) I finally stopped face up.  Although I was fully covered with debris I was able to use my hand to continually keep the snow out of my mouth.  The snow was soft enough I was able to dig myself out. I had to drop a pole at the last moment to protect my mouth and try to keep snow free around my upper body but with only one swath with my shoever I hit my poll.  As usual I always keep trees in mind and luckily I was aware of the trees up top and chose to stay left of the aspens. Afterwards I skinned up to check out the weak layer.  Thesnow failed on top a thin hard slab about 3 inches thick which layed above a melt freeze layer.",

        "Comments 1": "I was observed this slide and was not involved.  I was transitioning at the bottom of a run through the Lake Martha trees when I noticed a skier and snowboarder making a hasty exit from the northeast slopes of Tuscarora, headed toward the Millicent side of Lake Mary.  Retracing their descent I noticed they had come from the prominent northeast facing chute on Tuscarora, and had triggered a sizeable slide partway down it.  \n\nIt was difficult to get a great view because of the cloud cover, but the slide appeared to start about halfway down the chute as one of the riders was either putting in a ski cut or simply cutting hard to the left into an island of safety about 1/3 of the way down.  From my vantage it looked like either a wind or storm slab, as the bed surface appeared to be dusty.  The debris fan was roughly 200-250 yards wide, and it appears the slide ran roughly 1000 vertical feet.  \n\nI'm not sure if either rider was carried, as they both were making it out with all of their equipment and verbally confirmed they were unhurt, but it was not a spot I would have wanted to go for a ride.  \n\nYes it is the end of April, but there is a lot of new snow above 9000 feet.  Treat it with the respect it would garner mid season.",

The deepest part of the crown was 18 to 20 inches deep. The wind had loaded the slope and it looked like the weak layer was either the small amount of light density that fell on Monday or yesterday's storm snow, then it immediately stepped down to the old hard bed surface, I could still get the hangfire to crack out when I was looking at it.\n",

        "Comments 1": "While driving down SR 190 after skiing Short Swing we observed a powder cloud up one of the south facing steep slopes 100 to 200 feet above the road. After seeing a small sluff hit the road the powder cloud engulfed a silver 4Runner that was traveling up canyon. The impact of the slide was sufficient to move the vehicle into the snow bank. All passengers in the vehicle were able to get themselves out of the vehcile with no injuries. Fortunately, the down hill traffic was primiarly comprised of backcountry skiers, so we were able to quickly dig the vehicle out and clear one lane of traffic. \n\n \n\nA few comments. The passengers in the vehicle immediately got out of the car and sat on top of it to pose for pictures as we began to dig. Once someone from UDOT showed up with extra shovels various people started digging without a beacon. Others were wearing beacons but had turned them off as they had finished their tour and were on the way home. Our group had to remind people that we were digging because of avalanche activity. If you're already wearing a beacon and you're driving down the canyon on a high or extreme day, just leave your beacon on until you're home. If you don't have a beacon or necessary equipment and others do, maintain a safe distance. \n",

Did not dig down much to see exactly what the layer was that it failed on, but it was a density change in the snow. There were a bunch of weird layers going on that the wind slabs were breaking on. My partner Alex also got the chute to crack halfway across without a slide after I had been down already. This avalanche problem seems to be on all aspects and elevations. Later in the day I was causing little slides and cracking on test slopes closer down to the LCC road on the south facing slopes. ",

We observed some minor red flags on the way up such as a bit of cracking under our skis on steeper slopes and a small whumpf on the skintrack. Overall though it seemed like the new snow had settled out and we did not see a lot of evidence of wind effect except for one section of the skintrack around 9000' that was completely covered over. On the way up the steep headwall and on the traverse from the summit over to greaseball we kicked at some test slopes and got minor cracking, but nothing that propagated and no slabs.\n\n \n\nRegardless we figured it would be wise to do a ski cut before dropping in. We started down on a small ridge just skier's left of greaseball proper. My partner did a ski cut and got no result. He skied down to a rollover that dropped skier's right into greaseball and did one more cut. A 6\" slab released and propagated across the chute. As the slide traveled down it pulled out some deeper pockets about 10-12\" deep or so.\n\n \n\nIn total, the slide ran 1600' down the gully, right about to the point where the skintrack crossed it. The debris did not pile up that deeply in any one spot but fanned up out of the gully a little bit at the end. \n",

        "Comments 1": "Area traveled began around 7k and went up to 8400 feet; Upon approaching  8100 feet snow stratigraphy and avalanche hazard changed drastically.  Shooting cracks occurred on slopes of about 25 degrees; At 8400 feet I  was traversing vertically across the slope on a NNW facing slope, and I  was actually on a flat bench when I remotely triggered Chute number 7 in  the Argenta chutes. It broke 7 feet below the bench I was traveling on.  Collapse failure occurred from collapsing on the bench with shooting  cracks extending below me, the slope directly below me was no greater  than 25 degrees with a roll over 80 feet down hill. Catastrophic Failure  appeared to occur as a result of a failure in  compression because of  the slope being tied into the 35 to 38 degree rollover directly down  hill. Cracks shot out to riders left to where the slope ties into a  contour shoulder/nose that has a 35 to 38 degree side hill aspect facing  NE. Width at the starting zone was approximately 80 feet. Slope  checker-boarded below me and took off. Soft slab, yet in the low angel  starting zone it left soft chunks scattered about. Weak layer was  obviously surface hoar. No need for a hand lense here. The slope had a  shimmer and served as a great slippery bed surface. Upon observing slope  upon descent when heading back down ascending route it obviously  continued down hill propagating at each opening of the gully area. Slope  ran 1300 vertical, full course, It remained contained in the gully  without propagating to adjacent slopes. At it's widest apex it was about  120 feet wide. Crown face was between 12 and 14 inches. Slope did not  gouge in to older snow. Ran to with in 20 feet of the creek, 1350  vertical. Debris at the toe was minimal...2 to 2.5 feet deep. ",

        "Comments 1": "Discovered this large avalanche in West Monitor Bowl while hiking out of South Monitor, looks to have occurred in the early morning hours seeing that the bed surface had 3 inches of light density snow on it. Not really sure if soft slab is a good definition because the slab at the bottom was a one finger hard slab. The crown was on a 32 to 33 degree slope which roles over and gets steeper down lower on the slope. The crown averaged around 2ft but was 3ft in the middle. It measured between 450 to 500ft taking all the snow out to the ground. I did a crown profile which revealed light density snow on top with the slab getting stiffer moving down through the pack. It failed on facets on the October crust then stepped down to the facets below the crust at the ground interface, taking the crust with it. I’m positive that this slope has already avalanched once if not twice already this season.\nPhotos: crown and flanks of the avalanche, crown profile, and the runout, and a video showing the whole deal",

        "Comments 4": "Forecaster Comment: Below here we are copying and pasting in the words of UDOT forecaster John Woodruff. \" Here is a quick write up of what we are seeing in the Provo area mtns. Last weeks rapid warm up in temps had kicked the free flowing water into high gear for the start of the spring run off even at the upper elevations on everything but the upper N1/2 of the compass. Low elevation snow that still remains has gone isothermal, and the mid elevation snow is gradually moving that direction. Upper elevation snow is still a mix of damp round DH, crusts, fine grain damp rounds, large wet rounds, and slush.\n\nProblem #1 - This is the trickiest and easiest to overlook, but the persistent slab problem from the week layer that sits anywhere from 4cm to 20cm below the the Feb 18th dirt layer is still reactive. Pit tests on Cascade and Timp have both confirmed this with Compression tests yielding results ranging from CT23SP, CT25SP, to CT23SC in the past 2-8 days. This week layer is slowly turning into a deep slab problem as it joins the large wet rounding DH sitting on the bottom 20cm-35cm of the snow pack. All of this water percolating down is going to make these full depth releases a greater possibility. \n\nProblem #2 - Wet Slab activity will be increasing as this water pools above MF and rain crusts still intact with in the snow pack. Attached is a picture of a pit at 9900', ESE, 41deg slope on the east side of Timp. HS-90cm with wet saturated snow down to 76cm and water percolating through damp fine grained rounds and ponding just above the crust at 50cm in the snow. (The dirt layer sits at 33cm for reference). Until the water develops some reliable runnels and escapes through the rain/MF crusts these will form nice bed surfaces for these wet avalanches to start, and then step down to the ground once their weight overwhelms the weak damp basil layers. \n\nProblem #3 - Wind slabs (most likely to encounter). We have noted isolated wind slabs at mid elevations to large widespread uniform wind slabs at upper elevations that formed on the 27th-28th of Feb. They are gaining strength, however you can still pry them out. \n\nWe noted 4 separate avalanches on the upper elevations of Timp yesterday (April 1). All were on NE faces around 11000'. All 4 avalanches likely occurred on Wed the 28th from strong SW winds transporting snow onto the NE faces. We observed isolated wind slab formations in Primrose Cirque on the 28th that were easily triggered by a skier. \n\nThe first was on the Emerald Lake Headwall (Timp Glacier) a HS-NC-R2D3-O. 800' wide by 3'-5' deep. 11200' down to 10600' (600' vertical foot fall). \n\nSecond was below the summit shack on the NE face. HS-NC-R1D2 (wind slab). 60' wide by 2' deep. 11200' down to 10400' (800' vertical foot fall. Mostly due to steepness of area)\n\nThird was off the Timp Basin Ridge just north of the summer trail. HS-NC-R2D3-O. 500' wide by 6'-9' deep. 11000' down to 10800' (300' vertical foot fall) \n\nFourth was the largest. Thanks to the pictures from Turly we were able to determine that the entire slope to the north of the natural ax that he photographed including wrapping into Stairmaster bowl had avalanched. 11200' down to possibly 8500' (2700' vertical foot fall with a substantial debris pile) \n\nThe snow pack in the Hidden Lake Basin is around 145cm-270cm deep with the Feb 18th dirt layer at 70cm. Most of the snow depth in the Southern Wasatch has come after Feb 18th which means that we have a still reactive buried weak layer sitting on top of large moist just barely starting to round DH with a lot of very dense damp snow capping all of that. My personal take away point for all of this is that while this deep dense snow is capping the weak layers if you do manage to trigger something on the NE-NW upper elevations of the Southern Wasatch it will be big, deep, and not good. I suspect that these rapid warmups will increase the likely hood of pulling one of these slides out by tipping the stress on the snow pack close to the breaking point. There is still A LOT of the upper north side of the Timp Massif that has not avalanched yet.\"",

        "Comments 1": "One the way down the canyon this afternoon we noticed a recent large slide in the canyon right behind the old Zanavoo Restaurant.  The slide started on a steep north facing slope around 7600 feet and traveled 2400 vertical feet down to 5200 feet.  There was no fresh snow on the debris pile so it likely happened yesterday or today before 2:00.  It was a pretty impressive slide gouging down to dirt and mud and leaving a significant pile 10-15 feet deep.\n\nWe noticed other recent activity while we were out today but not nearly what we expected after seeing the large destructive avalanches in virtually every canyon on the Wellsvilles.  Below is a list of other slides that we saw today:\n\nThurston Hollow:  We saw a large avalanche, approximately 1/3 mile wide at the crown. At the head of Thurston Hollow (a south fork of Hyde Park Canyon).  The crown encompassed most of the bowl on slopes facing WSW through NW at 8400 feet elevation.  We could not see the runout zone but the width of the crown was impressive. \n\nSteammill Peak:  A 100 wide foot pocket release mid slope on an east facing slope between Steam mill 2nd and 3rd Peak.  The pocket was at 8900 feet elevation.\n\nState Line Bowl:  It looked like the Southern end of the bowl slid during the storm.  The slide was on an East facing slope around 8800 feet elevation\n\nTab Hollow:  A 400 foot wide avalanche was also notice on a northeast facing slope in Tab Hollow.  The crown was mid slope at an elevation of 8200 feet.  We could not see how far the slide ran\n\n \n\nWe found surprisingly stable conditions where we rode today.  We stayed on mostly east facing slopes between 8600 and 6500 feet.  We did not notice any collapsing or cracking of any kind.  There is a significant layer of rime on the ridgelines and surface hoar is grow in many areas.  We tested several steeper slopes by dropping 15-20 foot cliffs onto the slopes with no results.\n",

        "Comments 1": "[Forecaster Comment: We received two separate observations from this avalanche occurrence, where both parties were at the scene. We are publishing a single observation, with separate comments from each observer. We also added video coverage  submitted by Matt Buranich​] \n\nMark White:\n\nSaw this skier triggered avalanche while hiking out of South Monitor and went to investigate it. Looked to be the fifth person to ski the slope, and looked like he hit a thin spot in the snow pack and triggered the slide. Luckily he triggered it right on the flank and was not in danger of burial. The debris pile was at least 20ft deep, my probe would not reach the ground fully extended. The slide looked to have taken out the snow from our last two little storms and the bigger storm from yesterday, sliding on the hard crust from the warm spell before that. The boarder was about a quarter of the way down the slope when he triggered it and it fractured across and up-slope of the trigger point. Luckily he wasn't in the gut of it or it most likely would have had not ended well.\n\nMike Dawson:\n\nThree separate parties arrived at the top of West Monitor in quick succession. My party of two skiers descended first, without incident or any signs of instability. Shortly thereafter, while my party was ascending the skin track at the north end of the bowl, the second party of two also skied the bowl without incident. While the second party was at the base of the bowl, a solo snowboarder, the fifth rider to enter, remotely triggered an avalanche. (I gathered the following information from the boarder and the members of the second party). The avalanche started above and to the north of him, when he was approximately 30% through his run. The party below yelled up to alert the boarder, who immediately bee-lined it to the bottom. The avalanche fan caught up to him at the bottom but he stayed upright, having only been partially buried over his boots. The boarder lost his poles, which he dropped to hasten the bee-line, but was happy to be alive and uninjured. The party of two at the base of the bowl during the avalanche were also lucky to have been able to side step the deposition at the toe.\n\nOther Observations. This is a repeater avalanche, the first two times being in late December and mid January. Prior to yesterday’s storm, West Monitor had been heavily tracked. In spite of the wind that accompanied the storm, the new snow had no signs of slabbing or instability. Cornice cuts on the ridge yielded only minor sluffing. The avalanche ran completely in the new snow and did not step down into the old faceted layers. In retrospect, although the the new snow had no visible signs of slabbing from yesterday’s storm, there were red flags: 1. West Monitor is a repeater. No repeater is to be trusted until it’s bed surface is pouring out of your faucet in the Spring; 2. West Willow (another infamous repeater) had slid during the storm or shortly afterwards. We had observed the presence of the Willow slide earlier in the morning; 3. The avalanche advisory reported soft slab avalanche from control work in the same area with similar aspect, angle and elevation (although during the storm); 4. West Monitor had been receiving full sun throughout the morning, and this is a factor later in season (is it really later in the season, already!!!); 5. As I stood at the top of the bowl discussing the health of a buddy who had recently been caught and seriously injured in an avalanche, I had an instinctive twinge of reservation about skiing the bowl. Although me and my partner skied the bowl, ourselves, without incident, we realize now that we were just mighty lucky, as were the second party and the boarder who just happen to draw the short straw. I will be trusting instincts and staying away from repeaters for the remainder of 2018.\n\n[Forecaster Comment - Excellent writeup and retrospection of considering dropping into avalanche terrain. Although this may have been a repeater from earlier in the season, the slide ran on a stout sun crust that formed during the week of February 5. Two small storms (Saturday Feb 10 and Monday Feb 12) fell on top of this crust, followed by the larger storm on Thursday Feb 15. This avalanche took out the storm snow from these three recent storm events, and did not run on weaker faceted layers that would be present in slide paths from repeater avalanches.]\n",

        "Comments 1": "I was expecting fairly poor riding conditions today so I decided it would be fun to get up to a high summit to get a view and maybe get blasted by the wind.  This time of year I enjoy walking up the west ridge of the Birthday Chutes to the summit of Red Top.  If need-be, a relatively safe descent can be made following the ridge and skinner back to the White Pine road.  There are a couple short, steep pitches one has to navigate before you get on the ridge that I thought would be manageable in the current danger.  We broke trail from the road and the shady snow was good.  Higher, we were skinning up the ridge on generally wind-hammered snow when, at the location of the X in the illustration, I had a crack shoot out from my skis.  I could see that the whole slope to my left had spiderwebbed, but not moved.  As we (party of two) were marveling at the collapse, we saw a powder cloud shoot out from the bottom of the westernmost Bday chute.  It had slid wall-to-wall, to the ground, basically removing the entirely of the snowpack from the length of the chute.  No other chutes slid to our knowledge. The collapse must have propagated 150-200 feet to cause this. The debris piles were large, with big chunks of windboard in it.  As usual, the strong SW winds were loading this slope and I suspect this made the danger locally higher.  In the illustration the blue line is our skinner, the red line outlines the collapsed area, and the red hash indicates areas that slid.  A large area that was probably near 30 deg didn't slide.  \n\nOne thing I have been thinking about since the seriously unstable snow last weekend is whether or not one can look at a spiderwebbed slope as being as safe as an avalanched one.  If the fracture has already propagated across it, can you cause an avalanche by then riding it?  My intuition says 99% of the time this is true.  But not 100%.  Is this proof that the slope is not steep enough to slide?  I am guessing that with these slides failing on the ground, the friction of the bed surface is relatively high, and just because the slope didn't totally fail this time, doesn't mean that with a smooth suncrust as a bed surface it might not slide then.  We took the most conservative route down to avoid testing these questions.  Even though we had no intention to ski the Bday chutes, it was still a good scare at the beginning of the season to keep one honest.  The phone was dying so we didn't get but one poor picture that I didn't attach.  Flat light made visibility difficult anyway.",

After ensuring the path was clear of people, my partner approached the cornice and when he was about 10 feet from it, it remotely triggered the slide. It propagated around the corner from SE aspect to the due S aspect. Rapid wind transport was the main problem on this slope and due to this, I would not recommend traveling past the pass on guardsman road due to the chance of remotely triggering one of the steep slide paths that overhangs the road.",

Southerly aspects began shedding first as usual even at the upper reaches of the mid elevations. From 8500 down, even the northerly aspects were shedding from 1330 on. By the end of the day this cycle had included all aspects from at least 9000 feet down. The lower elevations were extremely dangerous in the afternoon hours even on the northerly aspects. \n\n \n\nAlso of note, many large and deadly roof avalanches began shedding on the 24th, but the largest and most dangerous roof avalanches had yet to shed by the end of the day on the 25th. With the Rapid Warming and unseasonably high temperatures forecast for Monday the 26th, the remainder of these roof avalanches will Likely be reactive and producing life threatening slides that have at least up to 30 cm of solid hard ice in their structure. \n",

        "Comments 1": "While working my way through Days Fork today noticed a fairly large slide in SE facing Banana Days. Not sure of when it ran but there was no new snow on the debris. Could have been last night once it quit snowing or this morning when the cornice heated up. Trigger was a large natural cornice drop, dug down into the rock slab at first then released a 20ft wide pocket with a crown 2 to 3ft deep, probably the last two storms worth of snow. When it ran it entrained quite a bit of snow with the debris pile fanning out to about 100ft at the toe of the slide. Ran about 1000 vertical ft before it came to a stop on lower angled terrain. Not a slide you would want to be caught in. Curious about when it slid since it seemed quite fresh, thinking it might have run today with the warm temps heating the cornice enough to make it calve off. Was not in the area until 2:00pm Powder Birds might have a better idea on the timing since they were in that area long before me.",

The only thing I'd add to the report the  guy sent in is that there was also extensive wind-loading in the area,  which is pretty normal for this aspect. The slide is actually on the  side of SP that rarely gets gets skied because it gets hammered by the  winds.  ",

Here are some photos and a quick summary. I will edit a more complete video and add additional information and a snow profile as time allows. Bruce Tremper\n\"Whisky Hill\" is a steep, popular hill climbing area on the eastern flanks of the Monte Cristo snowmobiling complex between Huntsville and Woodrruff Utah. The paved summer road between Huntsville and Woodruff passes near Whisky Hill but the road is not plowed in winter, making it a popular snowmobiling area. To get from the road to the bottom of Whisky Hill, most people have to descend one of two narrow, steep-sided ravines, one on the north side or one on the south side. \nA group of very experienced and well-avalanche-trained snowmobilers decided to descend the ravine on the south side of Whisky Hill. They were the first group to descend this gully since the last storm. They were spread out and the lead snowmobiler triggered a large, hard slab avalanche as he descended in the bottom of the ravine. He triggered it from the bottom and it fractured out the entire slope above him, which broke out in a hard slab 4' deep and about 400 feet across. The crown face (upper fracture) of the avalanche was about 250-300 vertical feet above the bottom of the ravine (and the victim).\nThe snowmobiler who triggered the avalanche noticed the slope buckle and he gunned his snowmobile in an attempt to escape but the avalanche caught and buried him in the ravine bottom about 4' deep and buried his snowmobile about 10' deep, just a few feet away from him. Both he and the snowmobile were pushed up against trees. The avalanche partially caught the next rider but he was not buried. The rest of the group quickly located the buried snowmobiler with beacons, then quickly struck him with a probe and several people quickly dug him out. It was a textbook rescue, executed flawlessly. They uncovered the victim in about 5 minutes. Luckily, this group regularly practices rescue scenarios and the practice paid off.\nAs a final note, they indicated that there was another group of about 6 snowmobilers following them that planned to descend the same gully. They did not appear to have any rescue gear. So perhaps the group that triggered this avalanche prevented a very tragic accident.\n ",

The slope that avalanched faced southeast, is 35 degrees at the top of the slab and 32 degrees on the lower half of the slope. The slope is only about 300 vertical feet and the avalanche was about 250 vertical feet from the fracture line to the bottom of the ravine and about 300 vertical feet to where the debris stopped as it traveled down the ravine. The slope is un-treed. Above the slope, there is a large, flat fetch, which is near the top elevation of the surrounding terrain, so the wind obviously had deposited a wind slab onto the steep slope. Strong northwest winds over the previous days transportd a lot of snow onto the downwind southeast facing slopes.",

The weak layer was a layer of faceted snow that formed in the first half of January. A period of heavy snowfall occurred during the last couple weeks of January capped off by strong winds from the northwest for the 2-3 days previous to the accident.\nIt's unusual for faceted snow to form on slopes that face the south half of the compass in Utah because at this latitude, the sun usually is warm enough to either prevent the formation of faceted snow or destroy it after it forms. For whatever reason, we have noticed a number of other avalanches on southeast facing slopes with a similar snowpack structure.\nMy snow profiles along the crown face of the avalanche showed Extended Column Tests failing on easy elbow taps and Compress tests failed on easy elbow taps as well (ECTP-11) (CT-11 x3). All failed on the faceted snow layer about 4 feet deep.\nThe avalanche advisory from the Utah Avalanche Center for the Ogden area mountains called for a Considerable Danger (orange, level 3) because of persistent slabs and recent wind drifting.",

Most of the north-facing apron on the north face of Red Baldy had slid, with crowns of 1-2' beneath the rock band. We also noted that the skier's rightmost Tri Chute had slid during the storm. I was unable to get a good picture on my phone, but indicated the location of the slide with red arrows. It appeared, like the Red Baldy slides, to be 1-2' deep and flushing the width of the chute.

        "Comments 1": "We observed this avalanche that most likely occurred within the last few days. This was a natural avalanche that appeared to have started as wet-loose rollerballs and stepped down to create a wet slab avalanche on a southeast facing aspect of the gully. The slide was approximately. 100-150' wide and ran 1200' vertical.  Probing in the bed surface there was still 170-190cm of snow left below the debris. This wet slab avalanche gouged out a significant chunk of the upper level snowpack and pulled to the ground in steep cliffy areas.  It did not run full path and started approximately halfway down the slide path. \n\n \n\nPhoto of the crown\n",

I dropped my first turn into the Cirque today into and everything I was standing on fell apart and started moving. The snow was just over a ski-width wide that I had dropped into. Maybe a little bold of a line, but that is a different story. Wet, heavy, and dragging would be the best words I could use for it. Luckily rolled out before the exposure, but shook me enough to send me home with my tail between my legs. Had all my gear, but am not certain the guy that was nearest had anything. I have noticed a lot of people without gear skiing the BC of Snowbird this weekend.

We decided to dig a pit just above the cracks on lower angle terrain to look for that weakness. \n",

        "Comments 1": "My little brothers were snowmobiling in American Fork Canyon when they came across a buried snow machine. They found it with just the ski poking up out of the snow. They stopped and dug around, believing that a person was probably buried as well. They did not have any avy gear (don't get me started on that...) but were able uncover much of the sled. My guess is that the slide was triggered from the sled crossing under the steep bank that was loaded with new snow. It broke out above the sled and came down on top. This all happened right on the road, at a spot with a steep, barren slope above the cut of the road. I've seen small rock slides in this spot during the summer. (A satellite view of the map above shows how abrupt the slope is) They called the police, and using the license information on the sled the police were able to contact the owner, who abandoned the sled after it was buried. Other than that, I have no other details. The incident served as a wake up call for my brothers. They understand now that any steep slope, regardless of the proximity of the nearest road, can be deadly. Luckily, it appears that nobody was hurt.",

Thanks Nate for the observation and getting back to me in timely fashion regarding my questions.",

        "Comments 1": "On our second lap on the north face of Sunset Peak I started down about 200 ft below the summit, after a few turns I looked back and saw only minor sluffing following me, skied lookers left of the center of the concave run cutting into center near bottom and ran out the run to Lake Catherine.  When I looked back up at my run I saw I had pulled out a pocket that had run over half of my tracks and left a debris pile about 2.5 feet deep stopping on the 20 degree apron, it was shallow enough my tracks that cut deeper could still be seen in the slide path.  My partners skied down the more protected tree line and informed me it had broke about three seconds after I passed the fracture line and moved rather slowly never threatening to over run me.  From  observing smaller sluffs it seemed a light crust had formed yesterday afternoon and the new snow about 4\" deep came down on top of it over night forming a very soft slab that was running on that surface.  Just before starting the run the sun came out for a very short time and a lot of point release sluffs occurred.  we climbed our uptrack one more time and skied some lower angle near by, one of my partners set off another small sluff that was not observed until we were back at the lake. Deciding we were pushing our luck we called it a day.",

As I entered the terrain feature I noted some cross loading but continued because it seemed quite shallow. I anticipated a possibility that some snow would move  given the slick crust but was surprised at the length of the cohesive pocket. The volume of snow involved did not present a threat for burial but could have resulted in a painful ride given the terrain. Luckily, I skied off the slab without incident this time. It ran about 350' of vertical into the apron below.\n",

Observed the path from Highway 189.  2) A large south facing path ran into the scrub oak, leaving a very impressive debris pile. Again, observed this from the car while driving on 189.  3) Another large slide could be seen from the valley on the SW face of Timp, running to Dry Canyon.  4) East side of Elk Point ran, leaving another big pileup not far above the Sundance Nordic trails. Saw the pile while xc skiing. The staff at the yurt said they'd never seen that path run so big.  I suspect all of these ran naturally during the upside down snow last week. These were big slides that ran from way up high and covered the full length of the paths. From some of the other obs and reports, it's pretty clear that Timpanogos was raining avalanches during the event.",

        "Comments 1": "This avalanche broke over 2000 feet wide. It happened naturally sometime Friday evening near the end of the storm. There was just a trace of new snow on the debris. It broke on 1mm facets just under a thick layer of graupel that fell at the onset of the storm. One avalanche professional who has worked in this area for a very long time said that he had only seen this slope produce an avalanche that wide twice in all his years.\n\nI got numerous collapses to occur in the meadows under this slope as I was approaching the debris field which tells us that a similar avalanche could occur tomorrow and the foreseeable future. Facets take a long time to heal and tend to only get weaker this time of year (they rarely get stronger this time of year).\n\nPhoto 1 - only shows 1/4 of the crown line\n\nPhoto 2 - You can see dirt in the graupel that was in the air in the valley when this storm began and was deposited with the graupel. Other avalanches in this area show a similar line in the crowns. It is significant only as a marker. Just below the graupel, I drew a line in the facets on which this avalanche fractured.\n\nPhoto 3 - Dark line roughly shows the crown except it broke higher right next to the rocks above the line\n",

This came off of a northern aspect near \"Rabbit Head\" for those familiar with signs on the road, and while there were plenty of trees and I couldn't visualize the top of the slide, the slope angle near the road was in the neighborhood of 35°. Avalanche debris was 6 to 8 feet deep across the road, which is not plowed in the winter but is frequented by snow cats, snowmobile's, UTVs with tracks, etc. Several passes had already been made over the top of the debris pile. The photo is taken from above and doesn't do justice to the depth of the debris. Given how dense the trees were and the nature of the terrain, I highly doubt this was human triggered as people typically don't ski that terrain and that low in the canyon. There was approximately 5 inches of new snow on top of the debris pile, suggesting this likely happened a couple of days ago . \n",

Another child witnessed the slide and knew their peer was buried. 911 was contacted and nearby adults starrted to spot probe the debris in the last seen location. 911 dispatchers contacted Alta Central, and they dispatched an Alta Marshall, Unified Fire Station 113, and Life Flight. UDOT employees on their way home overheard the radio call and responded to the location to assist. The area was marked off as a known roof slide location. \n\n \n\nRescuers were able to spot probe in the debris based on witness's last seen location and had a positive probe strike. The victim was buried approximately 1.5-2' under the snow, face down. They were buried for 5-10 minutes. They regained consciousness and were talking to first responders prior to being loaded into the air ambulance. \n\n \n\nThank you to everyone who responded; without quick action and availability this story may have had a different ending.

Looks like the entire bowl, except perhaps the small subridge between the two sides of the bowl, slid to the ground in the early part of the storm, perhaps as early as Friday night or Saturday morning as a fair amount of new snow had built back in.  Then the center of the bowl looked to natural again, new snow only, later in the storm, perhaps Saturday night or Sunday. So portions of the bowl have about 2.5 feet of new snow on top of what is left of the old depth hoar, with the portion that slid having about a foot of snow on top of a small amount of depth hoar.  Photos below: 1) the crown along the ridgeline of the most recent new snow slide, 2) the track with debris from the most recent slide in the foreground and rough debris from the deep slide just visible at the bottom, and 3) photo of the snow left on the bed surface with a couple notes.\n",

Hard to get a good look at it being so far away and through the trees, but it appeared to have failed into the weak facets below the slab. Looked very well connected and stretched north to south for a good portion of the east slope. We saw it on the 29th, but I'm guessing it slid a few days before that. \n",

        "Comments 1": "We skied Maybird Couloir late in the day yesterday, and hadn't seen the slightest sign of instability. We figured it wouldn't be terribly dissimilar across the canyon, even with the opposite (north-facing) aspect. By 7700 feet or so the snow had turned to ice and as we approach 8000 feet we decided to bail early, not wanting to skid down 1500 feet of ice. It had been snowing reasonably hard as we climbed, but it wasn't layering the ice with anything more than an inch or two. Or so it seemed.\n\n \n\nWe proceeded down with only the most minor of sloughing of the new snow. I skied 50-100 feet below my partner to wait for him. We had radios but wanted to keep within eyesight. We reached a point at roughly 7,500 feet where the snow was soft and fun and as I turned to take a picture of my partner skiing down, a wall of snow hit me and knocked me off my feet. My partner also got nailed (\"a shockingly hard hit\") but was angled in such a way that he absorbed the initial shock and skied to the side. He couldn't believe how much snow kept coming, given that what we were booting up for the last few hundred feet had been ice and we assumed it continued above us.\n\n \n\nAt this point I had been carried by the snow 800-900 feet out of sight. My partner put his beacon in search mode and started down, calling me on the radio. (We always carry radios.) I was trying to self-arrest but had foolishly left my whippets in the car and couldn't get my elbows down into the slope or anything to stop me. Had we been in Y-Not with cliffs, it almost certainly would have been much worse. Fortunately, the river of snow eventually spit me out to the left, maybe at about 6600 feet? My partner met me a minute or two later. All of my gear was intact (ironically, I was still holding the phone I'd pulled out to take a picture). \n\n \n\nIn terms of learnings, we felt like we had managed risk reasonably well, having observed conditions the evening before and as we climbed. THAT SAID, the snow started coming down pretty hard while we were climbing. Our best guess is that it was new snow piling on yesterday's load that triggered the release. We weren't really noticing how fast it was coming down, but that seems like the clearest explanation for where all that snow came from. In the same situation again, we'd turn around when in steep terrain when the snow starts to fall in earnest.\n\n \n\nSorry, no pics. We were both a little busy.\n",

A skier from a different party had traversed out to skiers left of the rock and had made a turn when the snow released from the rocks roughly 30 feet above him and carried him about 150-200 ft below. the avalanche continued on another 300-400 ft below him. We were able to keep an eye on him until he stopped and the avalanche continued past him. We checked with him and he was okay- no visible injuries, just shaken up a little. Looking up on the slide from below, we could see that the avalanche had propogated roughly 100 feet or so across the slope to the west, which was nearly all in the scrub pines We observed other much smaller slabs throughout the Baldy shoulder terrain, and the theme seemed to be same- heavier, wind loaded snow sitting on top of a crust and facets, which collapsed fairly easy.\nThis slide occurred while Alta Ski Area was not open yet for the season.",

        "Comments 1": "This was a very interesting avalanche because of how connected the slab was. This slope is concave (like the inside curve of a frying pan) and it looked like the grauple pooled at the transition zone creating a weak layer. How the slab became so connected and cohesive is the million dollar question?\n\nMy theory would be that the Hogum headwall must of seen a sustained period of wind, (15-30 mph) whether that wind blew up canyon or down canyon remains pure speculation, as I was a long ways out from this avalanche. It could of also been because of an intense precipitation spike during the storm as well. However, the avalanche looked fairly recent.  \n\nNot sure if heat or settlement of the new snow had any role in slab formation, as it was still very cold on the north aspects when I noticed this avalanche. This was the only avalanched I observed in my travels today and really the only instability worth mentioning. \n\nI did take a step back and had to realize this was a big avalanche, I was surprised to see such a connected slab. I would put this avalanche in the unmanageable category. I did cautiously continue with my planned tour and had no troubles in any of the steeper north facing aprons. \n\nFORECASTER COMMENTS:  This most likely failed on a layer of graupel that rolled off the steeper slopes and pooled below.  We were finding areas with graupel pooling directly after the storm.  Most areas with pooling were not all that sensitive but it was noted in our travels.  Kobernik\n\nSecond Photo:  Jim Harris\n",

The avalanche was 2.5 to 3 feet deep, occurred on a NE slope at 9800' and failed above the thanksgiving rain crust on facets. The slide ran to a natural bench feature at the bottom of the slope and stacked up a sizable debris pile. \n\nThis is a good amount of snow and the rider who triggered the slide appeared to make it off the slab unharmed.  Bottomline... avalanches continue breaking close to the ground, they're unmanageable and can easily ruin your day, end your season... or worse. There is great riding to be found on the south half of the compass where these persistent weak layers aren't hiding.",

The debris indicated that the slide ran  when the surface snow was still damp and or saturated from the overnight  rain and high temperatures. Debris piles had wet slab runnels, piles,  and tunnels from channeling. Debris was at least 5 feet deep and had run  at least 300 feet in length. Starting zones ranged from 42 to 37  degrees with a crown face and flanks of at least 12 inches. Width was  approximately 300 feet. It appeared that the initial weak layer was near  surface facets that were the upper 4 to 6 inches of old snow surface  prior to the new snow and rain that came in on Saturday evening. Of  note: it appeared that once initial failure occurred the slide stepped  down in several areas connected to the steep cliff bands where it was  able to pull out depths of up to and slightly over 2 feet. The weak  layer here was facets below the December Rime crust. This weak layer of  facets was up to at least 2cm of 4 finger snow with harnesses of at  least one finger directly above and containing the Rime Crust. ",

The avalanche picked up momentum and powered through some trees and over some cliffs. \n\n \n\nForecaster note: Much of Days Draw avalanched sometime in late November. We do not have a record of it in our avalanche database, but an avalanche crown(s) were observed in Days Draw on Nov 28th. It likely slid several days before this. UAC staff visited the site on Sunday, December 23. The crown averaged 12-24\", failing on a layer of very weak, early-season facets. There were several tracks throughout Days Draw, including adjacent to the slope that avalanched. Extended column tests on adjacent slopes were ECTX (no fracture), but results were ECTP23 at the crown of the avalanche, likely indicating the rider had just hit the sensitive \"sweet spot\" that could avalanche.

        "Comments 1": "Over the course of this extended and delightfully refreshing storm cycle, we've been skiing mid-elevation and largely wind-protected pockets of Millcreek and Neff's where we have continued to see very low density snow stack up with minimal wind effect on top of a snowpack with very prevalent facets and depth hoar. As we continued to find that snow in these areas hadn't consolidated and had no wind slab forming, we continued to buy into that feedback and sought out similar terrain options. This morning we met the end of that narrative in the form of a close call, sighs of relief, and lessons to be learned.\n\n \n\nWe were on our last lap of the day and had skinned up nearby the spot of the avalanche. As we descended the upper portion of the slope, we continued to get positive feedback (or confirmation bias) that the blower powder hadn't consolidated and was only acting up in the form of loose-snow sloughs when the angle steepened. Both skiers descended partway down the run, then skier 1 cut to the north for a longer fall line. As the skier turned within 20' of a perpendicular rock wall, the slope propagated and fractured along the edge of the cliff 100' down and across the slope, ending at a young pine tree. Skier 1 saw the slide break out, quickly turned away from the moving snow, and was not caught or carried. Skier 2 was not involved in the avalanche. The avalanche ran for 500 feet through dispersed pine trees. \n\n\nThe slope was approximately 35 degrees, northeast facing, and held around 18\" of low density powder. The crown was closer to 2' and slid on a firm crust with a thin layer of facets sitting on top. Underneath the thin crust (2-3cm) the snow was entirely faceted. About 50' below the crown, cracks where the slide had impacted below the crust were visible, but the slide did not step into deeper layers below the bed surface at the starting zone.\n\n\nOne of the realizations we've had is that in the previous six weeks of high pressure, we have witnessed the rapid decay of snow in rocky terrain on shaded aspects, which is precisely where the slab was triggered and propagated across.\n\n \n\nAnother key takeaway is that we're dealing with a very complex landscape currently and Nikki nailed it in her forecast today -- we experienced spatial variability in terrain that seemed very similar to what we had previously traveled and skied, but behaved extremely differently. \n \n\nIn hindsight, we can see how the accumulation of upwards of 16-18\" of snow over the past few days has led to increasingly more slab-like behavior as it has settled and received some degree of wind.\n\n \n\nFeeling the mountains gave us a free hall pass today, but not counting on any more.\n",

        "Comments 1": "At  approx 3 pm Alta Central received a call of a skier involved in an avalanche off the Emma Ridge. A party of two were descending Emma Two, carefully navigating the terrain, when one of the skiers triggered a small wet slide. The skier went for a ride and hit a large chunk of set up debris, pinning his arm, as momentum continued to carry him downhill, resulting in a possible fractured arm. There was  no burial and the injured skier and his partner, were able to ski down without additional assistance.\nThese two skiers were doing everything right by choosing a conservative route. However, spring avalanche conditions can change rapidly with just a little warming, a brief glimpse of sunshine, or a bit of greenhousing, and even a small wet slide in steep terrain can stack up a lot of snow in a hurry. I hope the injured skier recovers quickly from their injuries. ",

        "Comments 1": "After skiing Green's Basin and noticing few signs of instability we ended up slightly below the standard exit track that wraps around the ridge to low angle west facing terrain, and considered exiting the steeper north facing terrain instead. I did a ski cut of a rollover that was probably around 40 degrees and easily triggered this small avalanche. \n \n\nThe crown was only about 8\" so it failed on a density change in yesterday's storm snow. It wasn't enough to bury anyone and only ran maybe 50', but definitely showed how touchy the new storm snow is. Interestingly, the bed surface looked obviously wind loaded, and I wondered if a direct hit from a skier would have triggered a deeper break. We didn't stick around to find out, opting to put our skins back on and climb back to the standard exit. \n",

We had skied Wilson chutes and were making our way back to Butler Fork trailhead. We (two skiers, one splitboarder) chose to ski the south aspect of Wilson peak as our exit. The snow was warming up and top layer began to move. One by one, we decided to traverse the south aspect until we got to about 9000 ft. I moved quickly down the last section and because of the aspen, I couldn’t help but to ski the steeper face. I stopped at the bottom and looked up at the slide that had occurred and was still moving. It was piling up at the base in a grove of aspen. I was several yards away and protected from being hit. The slide was mostly the new snow from last week (8 inch layer), but where it was piling up was deep enough to bury someone. \n\n",

Most notable was what appeared, from a distance, to be a fresh deep slab release on the backside of O'Sullivan Peak, west of Tanners Col, running to the flats beneath E couloir of Twin Peaks.  The closest we got to the crown was the toe of Bonkers, so the dimensions I've provided are estimated.  I'm guessing it ran sometime towards the end of the storm on 2/12 or 2/13, as the debris still looked fresh.  This is either a repeater on a weakness leftover from the 1/20-1/22 cycle, or a slide on buried surface hoar from 2/3-ish.

Steep, narrow, sheltered, and shaded gully with a very difficult exit to the road. Very complex terrain that I'm not very familiar with and, in retrospect, should not have been in. 2 ski tracks going into it, 2 coming out, quick beacon search yielded no results. I don't think the debris was deep enough to bury someone unless they were really unlucky, but there were multiple terrain features that could have serious consequences (trees, rocks, gully). Cracking occured over a wide area but it actually ran in a much smaller area, through some trees and into another steep, narrow gully. The bed surface was a thin facet layer above a hard refrozen layer, perhaps 2 1/2 ft total snow depth ( I forgot to measure the total depth). It is noteworthy that this happened at a low elevation; only a few hundred ft above and within sight of the road.\n",

        "Comments 1": "Spent the day in Mary Ellen Gulch making observations and familiarizing myself with terrain.  Skied the southern aspects before 10 am and got out from underneath the steep paths and well away from run outs.  The wet activity started around 10:30am and lasted well into the afternoon.  The last significant release was between 14:00-15:00 and ran several hundred vertical feet.  The drainage was a mixed bag of orange-peel, wind-effected snow, settled powder, and sun-effected mank.  Good, safe skiing was found on mid elevation terrain features in the middle of the drainage.  Snowmobilers were getting after it with their high marking in the Outhouse Chutes and the Y-Not zone.  WPG had a blast skiing around the compass it seemed.",

        "Comments 1": "Broke trail partway up flagstaff shoulder for a quick lap then followed a party of two to the ridge. At the ridge I noticed a very large, very fresh debris pile in the bottom of upper days fork.  Worried that the party in front of us had dropped north, my partner and I followed their tracks up the ridge to make sure they were not involved. Thankfully, their tracks ended up descending into Toledo bowl. Not sure if they had set it off with cornice drop or the like, but neither me or my partner noticed any disturbance in the snow near the ridge.  We decided to traverses east to Emma 2. On the way over we got a view of the crown:  estimated at 3-5 feet deep on a rollover, mid-slope, in a stand of mature trees.  Probably D2-3, R3-4.  Anybody caught in this slide would have had little chance of survival.  ",

        "Comments 1": "I was driving east from Syracuse around sunset and saw the results of another avalanche cycle today with the increased temps. Several D1 and D2 slides ran on Francis Peak, Thurston Peak, and Mount Ogden. There were a few SW avalanches and plenty of W. Noteworthy were the half dozen or so NW D2 avalanches running at the upper elevations (as high as 9500ft or so near the summit of Francis Peak). Clearly, northerly aspects are now potentially active zones for avalanches.\n\n \n\nI was nowhere near there today, but the mention of glide avalanches in the forecast reminded me that Chilly Peak Slabs have glide avalanched in the past. This might not be common knowledge for folks new to the area/new to touring. It's worth giving that zone a wide berth this time of year.\n",

        "Comments 1": "Came across this slide today. Best guess would have had it happen on 1/3/15, with the East winds loading it and triggering it. There were snowmobile tracks in the vicinity, and it may have been triggered remotely. Slide appeared to have been initiated on the right flank in it's shallower area. In this area the slides weak layer was the mid pack facets. It then appeared to propagate downhill and step down at the middle of the crown. It went into the basal/early season facets leaving 4 inches of moderate sized Depth Hoar. As it descended over a rollover 80 feet downhill, it gouged out to the ground. Depth of slide at its apex was 34 inches, and this was after the last three days of warming. It had knife hard chunks in the debris and it's size was R2, D2. There was an inch or two of wind blown snow filling in the crown.  \n",

After 5 or 6 turns I triggered the slide. I noticed the movement and rode off to the side. The storm slab moved very slowly. With the addition of some cross loading from the previous days NW winds, the new snow was bonding poorly to the solar crust. Drew's forecast was spot on today.

NE aspect at 10,100'. A quick crown profile indicated two important things. (1) I was unable to isolate a column along its flanks even after the slope had collapsed, and failure was in the well documented December depth hoar, but (2) much weak snow still remained in the bed surface. \n",
        "Comments 2": "Very Poor structure abounds. This snow profile was taken at 10,200', E-facing West Bowl. HS 63cm. The Mid-Dec. slab varies from 30-40cm thick and is resting on top of F hard 4mm depth hoar. Stability tests continue to fail easily and propagate along the entire column. There's no wishing this avalanche problem away. It will be with us until either it avalanches or gets compressed by lots more snow. ",

        "Comments 1": "We were a group of two skinning up towards the mid-elevation low-angle meadows of Highline. We were loosely following a burried but visible existing skin track. We came around a corner to find a small, steep, and relatively isolated slope under a rock band. The rocks were about 35 feet above us and the slope was 20 feet wide.  After discussing options/precautions, skier 2 (submitter) stayed back in a safe spot while skier 1 stepped out into the slope. Skier 1's steps quickly triggered a slide in the new snow layer--roughly 6\" on average and starting all the way from the rocks above. Skier 1 stayed in place on their feet during the slide then continued across to sub 30 degree terrain just beyond the slope. \n\n \n\nThe slide was 20 feet wide and went 200+ feet downhill. At it's deepest, the new snow layer there was 8\" but was only 3\" up at the rocks. The slope where skier 1 triggered it from was 39 degrees. At it's steepest by the rocks above, we would estimate the slope was nearly 45 degrees. \n\n \n\nOverall the slide was small and the skier had no trouble standing in place while it happened. No movement at all in the 33 degree and 28 degree terrain over ridges on either side. However, we both immeadiately recognized that in larger terrain, the same situation could have been much worse. We double checked our plan and adjusted for extra caution.\n\n \n\nContinued our day and saw no other red flags above this point. However, we were getting a lot of sluffing, cracking, and movement in the snow at much lower elevations on our way out.\n\n \n\nIt was a nice reminder that established skin tracks are not always the best option. On our way out we realized cutting over 250' lower in elevation would have completed avoided this terrain. \n\n \n\n \n",

Our runs off Cardiff Peak and Powerline Ridge were all dry loose powder.\n\n \nOn Cardiac Ridge we witnessed two relatively small loose avalanches (perhaps D1.5) but they ran a long way, a few hundred feet at least, in popular terrain and across a skin track. All upper elevation east facing alpine terrain. The first photo is a dry loose (likely triggered from warming) that pulled out from the upper quarter of Thunderstruck Couloir and ran almost to the bottom of the apron. We saw this happen in real time and while it was running relatively slowly, it would have ruined your day. This released right around 12pm. The second photo happened between 11:30 and 12. A solo skier narrowly avoided this one. Similarly, I don’t think it was enough snow to bury a human but definitely cause an injury. \n \n\nNo huge suprise with the temps spiking, but just a heads up. \n\n",

        "Comments 4": "MEDIA REPORTS:\n\nAvalanches kill 2 men in Sanpete \n\nIdeal slide conditions: Dense snow, strong winds and warming are making the backcountry dangerous \n\nBy Jason Bergreen\nand Lisa Rosetta\nThe Salt Lake Tribune\nSalt Lake Tribune\n\n \n\nTwo men died in avalanches in Sanpete County on Saturday, the latest victims of what has become an unusually dangerous season in Utah's backcountry.\n Garrett Luke Gordan of Ephraim was snowboarding at about 1 p.m. when he was swept up in an avalanche near the top of Ephraim Canyon, said Andy Lyon, a Sanpete County Sheriff's Office sergeant.\n Gordan, who was carrying an avalanche beacon, was buried for about a half hour before friends dug him out. They administered CPR until Sanpete County searchers arrived and called in a Life Flight helicopter. The 26-year-old was flown to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo where he was pronounced dead.\n An hour later, a snowmobiler was buried in an avalanche east of Mount Pleasant in the Choke Cherry Ridge area, Lyon said. David Wayne Johnson, 42, of South Jordan, was dug out by searchers and flown to Sanpete Valley Hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n Craig Gordon, an avalanche forecaster at the U.S. Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center, said this winter is shaping up to be an unusual - and deadly - season for avalanches. Six people have perished in slides so far this winter, equaling the death toll of 2000-2001, according to Avalanche Center records.\n \"This is an unusual weather pattern, and unusual weather tends to produce unusual avalanches,\" Gordon said. A steady stream of storms in the region have brought high winds, heavy snowfall and fluctuating temperatures - \"the perfect recipe for a slab avalanche,\" he said.\n On Saturday, the mountains were blasted with winds up to 100 mph and between 6 and 8 inches of snow was forecast that night, said Bruce Tremper, director of the Avalanche Center.\n \"It's kind of a 'triple whammy,' as we call it,\" he said. \"We get snow, dense and heavy, extremely strong winds and warming temperatures. People without good avalanche skills should definitely avoid the backcountry.\"\n Avalanche danger continues to be high for all Utah mountains, even for low-elevation terrain, Tremper said.\n While snow, rain and wind pelted other parts of Utah, Saturday in the Salt Lake Valley was sunny and dry. Though strong southerly winds whipped through parts of Salt Lake City on Friday night and Saturday, the majority of a large West Coast storm wasn't expected to produce snow in the valley until after midnight.\n \"The main storm itself is somewhat stationary along the West Coast,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Tardy said.\n Several inches of snow fell Saturday afternoon in Logan, Price and Heber, Tardy said. Alta Ski Resort has received about 18 inches of new snow since Friday, 6 of which fell Saturday, he said.\n Winds gusting 30 to 40 mph were recorded in Salt Lake County, with some gusts reaching as high as 49 mph at the airport, Tardy said. High winds reaching up to 90 mph continued blowing in areas of the Wasatch Mountains.\n Snow in Salt Lake City could turn to light rain today with temperatures reaching the mid 40s. More rain was expected Monday, with snow returning to the valley Tuesday, Tardy said.\n jbergreen@sltrib.com,\n lrosetta@sltrib.com\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAvalanches Kill Two in Central Utah\nJan. 8, 2005\n\nSam Penrod reporting\n\nAnother deadly weekend in Utah's backcountry, as two avalanches kill two people in Central Utah. The slides both happened in Sanpete County Saturday afternoon, about an hour apart.\n\nIt's been a tragic day in Sanpete County. Two men were killed in separate slides, while snowboarding and snowmobiling this afternoon.\n\nIn the mountains east of Mt. Pleasant, a group of snowmobilers were in the area, when one of them apparently triggered an avalanche, around 2:00 this afternoon. One person was buried in the slide, but those in the group eventually were able to dig the victim out. But he could not be revived.\n\nSaturday evening, volunteers from the Sanpete County Search and Rescue were able to recover the victim from the avalanche.\n\nSheriff Kay Larsen/ Sanpete County Sheriff's Office: \"There was approximately ten people up there snowmobiling together. They had lost sight of him and could see the tracks where it had slid, and went down there. [They were] able to get him out of the snow, but unable to revive him.\"\n\nAbout an hour before the Mt. Pleasant slide, a 26 year old man who was snowboarding got caught in an avalanche in Ephraim Canyon. The victim was buried in the slide, but was wearing an avalanche beacon and someone who was with him was able to dig him out and started CPR.\n\nThe victim was airlifted to Utah Valley Medical Center where he died.\n\nTonight authorities are identifying the victim as 26 year old Louk Gordon from Ephraim. And in the Mt. Pleasant slide, 42 year old David Wayne Johnson of South Jordan was killed.\n\nAuthorities say heavy snow earlier in the week and then the warmer temperatures today likely caused both slides.\n\nAvalanche Warning\n\nThose fatalities make five avalanche-related deaths in the last month.\n\nAnother smaller avalanche-- about 4-feet deep-- has closed the road up Little Cottonwood Canyon. Authorities are telling everyone to get out. An avalanche warning is in effect for ALL Utah mountains, and that warning will remain in effect for the rest of the weekend.",

        "Comments 1": "There is a steep rollover at the bottom of Main Days.  A small, short sweet slope with a wider, less steep slope to skiers left.  It looked delectable and I center punched it.  Two turns in I saw the cracks form and most of it let loose.  It was somewhat similar to a big sluff, but it had a crown and it was a slab.  I took a short ride.  I tried to ski off to the side and missed the brunt, but I discovered it is difficult to ski to the side when the slope is moving downhill.  I ended up mostly covered with snow, but I wouldn't say I was buried.  I did lose my prescription sunglasses and was very lucky and grateful to find them. \n\nI did not measure the slope angle so 40 degrees is an estimate.  I did not inspect the bed surface, although I am reasonably confident is was the new snow-old snow interface.  The 5 turns I made at the bottom of the little avalanche were soft, and creamy.  Slabs are difficult to identify.\n\nWe had previously skied a NE facing aspect of Upper Days.  Skied a WSW aspect of upper days afterwards.  Went up a questionable skin track up the Days headwall to exit.  Saw no signs of instability and the snow didn't feel slabby to me.  Face shots were not abundant but did occur.  \n\nAs I watched people ski the days headwall, which had more snow, I wondered how different the conditions were on those aspects compared to what slid on me.  I think not much.  A couple of degrees in steepness and few degrees in aspect.  The skiing was fabulous and will be better tomorrow.  I think most of us tease the dragon more than we know.  ",

        "Comments 1": "Our party of 4 spent the morning in Cardiff. We were aware of the forecast and our primary concern was wind loading/wind slabs. After skiing 2 different lines in the drainage without much evidence of wind load, we decided to ascend the northeast facing collie between Cardiac Ridge and Ivory Flakes. As we ascended we took note of areas of obvious wind loading and worked to avoid these as we skinned up toward the top of the collie. Nearing the top of the ascent, we noticed a significant change in the snow as it became much more stiff. We discussed this and continued ascending working to aboid the obvious wind slab. As the chute narrowed toward the top we ended up bumping up against the slab on the skinner. We then saw out first shooting crack of the day the slab paused after cracking and then released. The slab broke just uphill of the lead skinner, who was able to step off of the slab. Second skinner in line was caught on the slab and took a 40 foot ride down the chute before self arresting. The slab contined down the chute and onto the apron. Slide was D1 in size. \n",

No cracking either and the snow was still light/hadn't heated up yet, so we decided Bombay chute would be relatively safe to ski as long as there was a safe entrance into the chute and we could get well below the cornice. There was a safe entrance and the chute skied well. The snowpack was a little punchy skiing down, but otherwise felt stable. About a minute after both myself and my friend got down and were in a safe zone, we were looking back up at the chute and observed a natural cornice break that fanned into a dry loose avalanche that could have easily carried a rider over a small but rocky cliff band had someone been in the chute at the time. \n",

There were a few tracks along the ridge before our party reached it and two ahead of me did not have any issues. I went about 40 yards past where my buddy dropped. The aspect changed slightly north at this point and was a bit more exposed and wind blown. The snow pack was about 2 feet deep on the slope and it was a bit more open at the top than areas surrounding it. Forecaster's note - see small arrow in middle of second picture for location. The slope started to break apart around me on my first turn it. It was a soft sugary slab that I though would just sluff off. Fortunately I let my momentum carry me skiers right to get on more stable ground and let it sluff off. I was scraping rocks by the time I got good footing and could grab a tree. The slab actually gained strengh and widened quickly. It sheared at the snow/ground interface and moved into the trees. The trees did not provide an anchor and it continued to widen and gain strength. It finally ran out after 400 or so vertical feet. Getting caught would not have been good.",

The snow is highly wind affected in the foothills right now, and I got careless given how thin and anchored the snowpack is in most places. The snow broke on faceted snow.\n\nI was making my way down the northwest face of the peak, basically just traversing and doing kickturns given the mix of breakable crust, ice, and wind drifts and ended up on a very obvious wind slab on a ~35 degree slope. My second traverse on it I heard a whumpf/cracking sound and the snow around me fractured. Fortunately, the snowpack isn't very deep so I think I only got carried maybe 3-5ft on my side, very slowly, before I basically sunk down to the faceted snow and thus grippy snow below that and came to a stop using my skis and poles.\n\n \n\nFrom where I stopped the crown was about 10ft above me and was anywhere from 1ft-2ft thick and went diagonal along the slope.\n",

The area was south wind-loaded and remotely triggered, likely by a skin track along the above ridge. Photo shows the weak early Dec. drought layer marked as the weak layer and the rime crust layer above. This photo is a good example of why the drought layer is still the player of concern in the area being mid-snowpack and well within the top meter of snow. Very possible to be triggered by humans and today's remotes showed this. \n\n \n\nArea snow safety specialist/educator Robby Young describes the layers and the repeater possibilities with the drought facet layer as he describes this slide (video).",

        "Comments 1": "This morning on the way up to circle all peak there were several small avalanches that appeared to have released naturally overnight. These were mostly located on the southwest facing steeper terrain on the East side of the normal skin track right off of the Butler Fork trail head. The largest on was likely around 70 feet wide and definitely large enough to knock a person off of their feet into the terrain trap below. I measured the slope angle in a couple of places and found it to be about 45 degrees where the slides occurred, with crowns about 8-10 inches deep. The cause of the slides may have been due to the upside down new that was noticeable throughout the morning forming a small slab that slid on the new snow old snow interface, although I didn't have time to dig into the details this morning. Overall a minor slide here that could be very telling for bigger, steeper terrain today. \n",

        "Comments 1": "After a dry first three weeks of January, and limited snowfall through Oct, Nov, and Dec, the underlying snowpack was very weak and faceted. Approximately 32\" of snow and 2.5\" SWE fell between Jan 22-30, with the last 8\"-12\" (.6-1.0\" SWE) falling on the night of the 30th. A three day period of sustained 25-35 mph southerly winds occurred mid-week, in between storm systems.  \n\n \n\nI had just finished digging a pit in the trees north of the Coyote Chute starting zone. Results were ECTP 23 on November facets about a meter down. I walked on to the northern edge of the bowl that makes up the starting zone for Coyote Chute to see if it would collapse. It did and I heard a low deep whumph followed by successive whumphs across the bowl and I could see cracks all the way across it for approximately 300'. It did not slide. At that point, the aspect changes to more easterly and the slope disappears from sight. I walked up to the ridge and discovered the avalanche another 200' beyond. All told I triggered it from 500' away. \n\n\n\nSnowpit dug nearby showing my ECTP 23 results on the November facets. Discussion of the snowpack in the video below. All done prior to the avalanche. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of the avalanche. Excessive hangfire prevented closer investigation and the actual width is unknown but I could see debris that made it to the valley floor. The video below details the widespread craking over the entire distance of the actual slope failure, approximately 500'. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

        "Comments 1": "Remnants of a large cornice fracture was observed starting from the high point of The Other Runs to the skiers right. this failure propagated .19 miles east, down ridgeline. The cornice failure looked to have triggered several avalanches down slope on the Northerly aspect. The most notable was the slide in the skiers right side of the prominent slide path \"the other runs\" which failed from the top of slope. Sliding on what looked to be close to the ground as rocks and shrubs were still visible. We could not investigate the crown or bed surface as new snow and wind loading had already began to reload the slope. This run was in our groups closed run list so a proper investigation was not warranted.  The second most notable slide was roughly 60' down slope in the wide spaced trees east of The Other Runs main slide path. This looked to be a step down with roughly a three foot crown. Probe pole depths of the remaining fracture material were 185cm-225cm deep.  Our group initially noticed a small hole close to the tree line on the ridge and as we looked closer we traced the fracture running east. Many blocks of  multiple fractures remian on the ridge and are much farther back in the root of the cornice than expected and snow bridging has already begun.\n\n \n\nNote: this ridge line should be traveled with cation as new cornice has already developed. Collapsing a snow bridge above an existing fracture could result in a leg injury. This ridgeline is best traveled with a probe to identify that you are not on the leeward (wind loaded) area of the ridgeline. \n",

We went back and inspected the crown and had some good pictures so I figure we would submit a report as well. \n\n\t \n\n\tWe skinned up to the top of Red Top from the White Pine parking lot. A man and a women were behind us as we ascended Red Top. On the ascent it was around 30 degrees F but the wind was blowing 25-30mph gusting to 40mph. As we skinned we mentioned to each other multiple times that it seemed odd that there was not a section on wind slabs in the morning avalanche report. We skinned to the far skiers right chute and the group behind us stopped above the middle chute. The first skier in on our run popped out a small wind slab but it didn't run and was easily avoided. \n\t \n\n\tForecaster note: Sometimes we hate forecasting in spring because the weather is so changeable. The winds were not \"supposed\" to blow very hard. Spring! If it isn't one thing it's another.\n\n\t \n\n\tWhen we got to the bottom we saw that the group behind us had triggered a large avalanche. We skied over to make sure they were both okay. The man said he had triggered the avalanche at the top and ended above the snow almost at the toe of the debris. He was very shaken up. He was super lucky and definitely knew it. He was able to find both skis but lost a pole and his goggles and hat. He was able to ski back down, but said that his right ankle hurt a bit. The woman had skied down after him and was unharmed but also a bit shaken up. \n\n\t \n\n\tWe skinned back up to the top for a second run and to take a look at the crown. It looked like the man had skied first and as he traversed into the run he was on top of a hard slab that broke almost 50ft above him. The crown was only 25 ft wide but almost 2ft deep initially then broke a shallow wind slab down the whole west facing ridgeline around 150ft wide and maybe 5 inches deep (however it was hard to tell how deep the slab was because by the time we got back to the top it had almost filled back in). The avalanche ran over rocks and through a choke pulling the old soft snow with it. As the avalanche hit the apron it fanned out. The debris pile was only between 2 and 3 feet deep, however there were still chunks of snow 3ft by 3ft by 2ft.\n\n\t \n\n\tVery glad that everybody was okay, and definitely a learning experience for me.

The rider tries to deploy his airbag, though is unable to successfully engage and he's buried with a hand sticking out of the snow. The sledder briefly loses consciousness, but everyone in the group is wearing avalanche rescue gear and they quickly locate the buried rider and dig him out. The group is pretty rattled, but after taking some time to regroup in the Whitney Basin warming hut, they ride back to their rigs and return home safely.. Whew... close call!\n\n",

From the activity observed in the Brighton Periphery, it appears that this slide would have been a Storm Slab with a contributing Wind aided factor. Of note, in the Brighton area, there was a significant density break issue directly above the old snow new snow interface from yesterdays 4 to 6 inches where it interfaced with the new 15 inches from Monday night into mid morning hours on Tuesday. Speculation would have the possibility of a Melt Layer Recrystallization occurring at the melt freeze layer prior to Mondays event under the minimal melt freeze that occurred Monday afternoon due to daytime highs and ambient heating. Regardless, whether this is true or not, there was a definite density break issue at this layer. The wide propagation was unusual and propagation was able to be initiated by our parties in many areas where wind loading had consolidated the Storm Slab. In the Brighton area, these were soft slabs ranging from 24 to 8 inches deep, with widths of up to 150 feet. They ran to transitions.  \n",

Ascending to the east and looking across we saw the adjacent slope (to the west) had also slid. There were tracks on the ridge from the previous yurt guests and we don't know if they were possibly remotely triggered or were natural. We saw them on the evening of February 17th and they clearly had been snowed on since sliding. \n",

        "Comments 1": "My wife and I had a great morning boarding in Mill D North Fork.  For most of the morning temps were nice and cold and the new snow stayed light and powdery and everything seemed very stable.  As the day wore on and the temps and sun rose, the snow started to get more damp and stick to my skins so we figured it was time to leave.  We headed back to the car by taking a relatively direct route from the top of Reynolds down the South face back to the Mill D parking lot.  The conditions on that aspect were about 5 inches of new snow on top of a solid and slick sun crust.    As my wife descended first she initiated a small point release behind her which looked like minor sloughing of the new snow on top of the sun crust.  It moved pretty slowly (never more than 10-15 mph max) but started to get wider and pick up more and more snow.  It eventually caught up to her when she stopped and carried her for about 50 feet until she grabbed a small tree and it continued (still slowly) another couple hundred feet.  The whole thing probably lasted more than a minute and carved all the new snow off the slope down to the sun crust.  It never moved quickly or violently and didn't seem like it would have buried anybody but it would not have been pleasant had it pulled anyone over a cliff or other hazard.  In retrospect we underestimated how fast the sun and rapidly warming temperatures were changing the snow conditions.  We also could have chosen any number of less direct return routes to the car that would not have been nearly as susceptible to this type of activity which was clearly predicted in the morning avalanche advisory.  It is interesting to note that the underlying crust was so slick it seemed that the wet snow continued sliding on slope angles that were substantially less than 30 degrees.",

Snow observation and conditions at the time were stable there were no rollers as seen in photos during the approach. Reported by a secondary party who was skiing Bonkers that another party had passed them and summited the ridge of Bonkers at the time the avalanche occurred it is suspected that snow was kicked off the top causing the wet slide to come down and hit our party.  \nClose call could have been a lot worse.\nA reminder to know what is below you before kicking snow down!\nAfter the slide the route plans changed and all in the party made it down safely. \nBelow is a photo of the approach to Bonkers with the cliffs above where the snow came off.\n\n\n\nForecaster note: I switched trigger to unknown.  This slide could have been triggered by a party above or it could have initiated by snow coming off the warming rocks.  I don't think we'll know unless it's confirmed by the party above that they triggered a wet loose sluff.  Glad this close call had a good ending.",

After gaining the ridge of bonkers we went up a little higher but dropped into stairs before gaining the ridge between big and little cottonwood canyon. We were the only party to ski upper stairs as of about noon. Not sure of others were up there after us. We also noticed significant wind loading on the north end of the compass. We intentionally triggered a very small wind slab into stairs that was only a couple inches deep and a few feet wide that maybe ran 100 feet but did not break into deeper layers.Notes from another party that day - \n\n ",

        "Comments 1": "Forecaster Note: We received multiple reports of this avalanche, so all additional photos and comments have been added to this observation.\n\n\n\nCame up into main porter today and quickly noticed a large crown on the Ice Box about a hundred feet below the ridge, presumably from overnight. Crown appeared to be about 5-6' deep and a few hundred feet wide, but hard to tell from such a distance. Also noted a few dry loose slides high in the Sox's area that did not break into a deeper layer.\n\n\n\n(N. Pearson) One of many naturals that went in Porter fork during high PI rate on the eveing of the 13th. This one ran in the corner pocket of iceboxin Main Porter about 100 lower than the ridge. The Majority of this slide had about 4-6 foot crown. Broke all the way around to the northwest facing steep slope with a 2-3 foot crown on average. I estimate this slide to be about 400-600 ft wide. Debris ran down the gully about 1000 ft and deposited in the flats. Takeaway from this and many other very large slides in the area is to activily aviod gullies, be congnisant of overhead hazard that may be 300-1000+ feet above you, and don't trust some of the standard skin tracks in the area. There is a lot of danger in the Porter Fork area in Milcreek. These large slopes are primed and ready to fail if they haven't already done so. There is plenty of snow hanging out on the rest of Icebox that could result in a slide 2-3 times larger.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n",

        "Comments 1": "Dimensions are approximate from viewing from the toe of the debris.\n\nI was up in this area with my pals from the UDOT snow safety team about a week ago during the high pressure.  We all noted how weak the snow was in this area.  Both the surface and near the ground had weak faceted snow and we speculated that it was weak enough that it wouldn't hold much weight from new snow storms.  Looks like our assumptions were right.  It was difficult to see the initial fracture but the avalanche definitely ended up gouging to the ground as it ran.  Wind drifting no doubt played a role here.\n\nWe didn't really guess on how much water it would take before avalanches occurred but I attempted to measure it today.  It was a bit difficult due to how much the wind had stirred things up but my rough measurements were 14.5\" of snow over the last week on top of the old faceted snow surface.  The 14.5\" of snow contained about 1.6\" of water.\n\nOf note, the paths that threaten the road lower in the canyon still don't hold much total snow.  At the forks of the Huntington I measured 6\" that fell over the last week.  It contained .47\" water.\n\nBelow, decent pile of debris with a few logs in it.\n",
        "Comments 2": "Also of note, the wind direction did not lend to loading the large road cut near the Electric Lake Dam which is a usual suspect of hitting the road. The strong northwest wind actually stripped it rather than loading it.",
        "Comments 3": "Assessment: This storm ended just as the scales were about to be tipped. A few more hours of snow and wind and this area would have gone through a much more widespread natural avalanche cycle. This was the only notable avalanche that I was able to see. The weak snow remains near the ground now with a decent slab on it. It will be need to be monitored with any significant new snow storm.",
        "Comments 4": "This small avalanche did break off a few trees but it probably didn't take much to snap them since this was the site of a large forest fire. All of the trees are just charred trunks that have been standing for a number of years.",

        "Comments 1": "I'd been skiing Silver, Days, and Emma all morning/early afternoon, and dropped down a line that's to the right of Doug's Drop (on the Silver/Days ridgeline).  it starts mellow, then rolls over briefly to 40+ degrees, then backs off again.  There was one track down the slope from this morning (when it was colder).  The snow had been pretty decent powder, but the sun poking through - as per Trent's forecast - but with considerable cloudiness made it seem like things were greenhousing in the early afternoon.  I thought that a high, east-facing shot would have better snow and be a little safer.  I dropped down the lower angle bit, went around the rocky entrance to the chute, then dropped in skiing fast and - channeling my inner snowboarder (which isn't too deep; I pondered riding my board today) I skied it off fall line with the prospect of a slow, wet slab following me down (thinking about Ian McCammon's slope angle study that indicates that wet slides need more pitch than powder soft/hard slabs:  http://gblanc.fr/IMG/pdf/mccammon2009.pdf ) \n\nOnce down in the flats I stopped, turned and indeed I saw a wet slide trundling down the slope.  It wasn't moving fast, but having been caught in wet slides before, I knew that it had a bit of that \"heavy\" power.  The \"crown\" was literally a few inches deep in the steepest part of the chute where my entrance ski cut was, but the entrainment of plenty of snow was notable.  It ran down to where the slope backed off to the mid-20's and stopped.    The debris was not deep enough to bury someone but enough to pull of a (releasable!) ski binding and bury that, and maybe tweak a knee (which has happened to me).  \n\nI needed to exit the Emmas and they were even gooier, so I was quite careful to keep my slope angles under 40 with the little rolls and terrain traps in there, and that worked out fine.  \n",

        "Comments 1": "Spotted this slide on the drive to work today.  My first thought was human caused, but after looking around at the debris which had a few inches of new snow on top, this likely occurred from gusty winds overloading the buried weak facets.  Or possibly this was triggered from riders on the ridge which I could not confirm.   The avalanche depth ranged from a couple feet to over 6' and failed on facets above a crust formed back in October.  Walking up the bed surface there was still a slick firm crust with weak sugary snow that will get buried with future storms and this could be a repeater slide later this winter.  \n\n\nFORECASTER NOTE- Ted knows the western Uinta's better than anyone around and his observations, snow and avy expertise are top notch. We were a bit baffled by this one. The tracks near the slope were from yesterday's group of riders who DID NOT trigger the slide.... there was a few inches of snow on the bed surface from the night before.  We talked this one through and concluded the slide was remotely triggered either from low on the slope or from the ridge above Yamaha Hill.",

The slide ran pretty fast and far, traveling the whole length of the chute. It did not step down to any deeper layers. Not deep enough to bury someone but definitely could have taken someone for a ride if they got caught. Today this problem was manageable but these windslabs developed in just a few hours of higher winds, so if winds continue to blow I would expect potentially deeper slabs tomorrow.\n",

        "Comments 1": "Working at Soldier Hollow Biathlon. On the morning of the 15th noticed the three slides on the East, South East face of Mill Canyon Peak. Temptation, Tom's Canyon and Left side of Tommy Gun. The whole East face basin off the top of the Peak had released with the crown face, Approx. 6'-4' x 1/4 mile long? Plus raced around the north corner of the basin. It is identified as Temptation in the Wastach Back Country map.\n\nThe two other slides, most of Tom's Canyon & the left lower side of Tommy Gun slide. There was a minor earthquake early that morning, just saying. Can not say for sure that was the cause of all three releasing but it would be interesting to check out the debris pile in the bottom of the Temptation basin. I have attached images of the three slides, one of all three and a topo with approx. placement. It was eye opening. \n",

My wife and I were the two skiers in the party. We had skied the same run on Banana Days about 90 minutes before. It was warming up and in hindsight, while we were certainly aware of the large cornices, we perhaps should have not skied that run again. My wife skied first and her plan was to quickly ski through the chute and out onto the wide apron. I was watching from a safe spot. She was about 200' down when I saw the cornice crack. I yelled at her and she was able to quickly cut a straight line to her right and out of harm's way. Fortunately the cornice did not trigger any type of slab. I quickly skied to the last place I saw her and then heard her yelling from below that she was OK. I followed her tracks to the right.\n\n \n\nThe lesson here for us was a reminder that cornices can go at any time, but they are especially scary when the sun is beating down. \n",

        "Comments 4": "From another party-\n\n\n\nRemotely triggered slide on banana belt observed from the skin track up chicken shit ridge. The first skier was about 150-200' down banana belt and exiting the choke of the chute just below a lot of cliff bands. ~10,000ft, NE facing. The ridge above was heavily corniced above the cliffs. Skier was able to exit to their right to avoid the slide which broke above them, the second skier in the party descended the same path quickly after and appeared to be situated on the ridge further to skiers right of the cornice failure at the time of the slide. Both skiers were able to ski down unharmed. After assessing the terrain and situation as best we could from our vantage point, we determined it was most likely a remote trigger of a cornice on the ridge which then fell through the cliffs and into the run, taking a decent amount of snow from the cliffs with it. Slide was about 40' wide and ran about 300' vertically. The sun was out in force at the time of the incident (about 12:15pm). Although the slope was mostly shaded, the cornices on the ridge were getting hit pretty hard in the sun. The slide did not appear to have been a cohesive slab, but definitely did have enough volume from the cornice and cliff face to have taken a person for quite a ride, potentially through some trees.\n\n",

Not sure on the size of cornice.  there was small cornice debris at bottom,  probably a rough ride over the cliff for the cornice.    Also saw somebody ride seagull chute successfully. ",

        "Comments 4": "A UDOT maintenance worker witnessed a natural avalanche at about 12:30 pm on Wednesday, January 11. It occurred directly across the highway from a popular parking lot for riders coming off the backside of Beaver Mountain (out of bounds). No one was caught in the slide. He immediately notified his crew and closed the highway. Paige Pagnucco (UAC and UDOT forecaster) responded from Beaver Mountain and traveled to the avalanche site to assess the situation. It was quickly determined that with forecast continued heavy snowfall and strong winds, the road would remain closed. UDOT, UHP and Beaver Mountain staff worked in cooperation to create a plan to get people safely down Logan Canyon.\n\nBill Nalli (UDOT avalanche supervisor) was notified immediately when the avalanche occurred and he traveled to Logan to help evaluate and mitigate the avalanche danger. Once the road was closed and cleared, UDOT mitigated determined areas of avalanche danger with explosives. The canyon re-opened the following morning with no further incident. \n\nPaige Pagnucco investigated the avalanche on 1/12/17 and found the weak layer to be small facets sitting just under a thick but brittle crust about 50 cm up from the ground. The area is very rocky underneath the bed surface and facets of various sizes exist. The trigger appears to be the intensified snowfall rate that occurred during that time. Combined with strong winds, the weight of the new snow overloaded the weak layer and caused it to fail . The avalanche occurred on the lee side of a small subridge. The height of the slab was 85-110 cm. \n\nBoth lanes of the highway were covered with about 4-5' of debris for about 150'. \n\n ",

On their last run, they skied off the NE side of Peak 9924, which is on the ridge between Broads Fork and Mill B South. It is a 2,000 vertical foot run. The upper half is a 35-degree slope through gladed trees and looks like a deceptively easy descent but the lower half rolls over into a series of cliffs the bottom of the Mill B South drainage.\nTwo skiers descended partway and waited in some trees. The third skier started down while the fourth skier waited on the ridge. The third skier got about 4 turns into the run when he triggered a large, hard-slab avalanche about 3-4 feet deep and quite wide. He yelled \"Avalanche!\" to the others below and one was able to grab a tree and the other scrambled out of the way. The third skier was going to deploy his avalanche airbag pack but he impacted a tree before he could pull the trigger. The tree stopped him and the debris washed over him and buried him with his head sticking out. He injured his knee in the impact with the tree. The fourth skier on top came down with his beacon on receive and found the third skier and helped him get out. Luckily no one took the full ride to the bottom because it would most likely be un-survivable because it descended through gladed trees and over several cliffs on its 2,000 vertical foot path.\nThe injured skier hobbled down, sliding on his rear much of the way. He found one of his skis about halfway down. It was difficult negotiating the various cliff bands. At the bottom, he was able to ski out on one ski. He was obviously very lucky.",

        "Comments 1": "Went for an afternoon tour. Found no instability on the windward south facing ascent but quite the opposite just off the ridgeline from 7000 down to 6500 ft where the wind has transported and loaded the S/SE leeward ridgeline. Knowing the instability, we descended the ridgeline and found a good test slope. As soon as I stepped onto it a crack propagated and the slope released. No pop, not a lot of energy, but it could have carried and buried a skier if it had room to run and entrain more snow. Snow broke on soft fist hard rain crust from earlier in the storm.\n\nWith this event we chose to ski dense pines on N facing slope. Found no additional instability. \n",

        "Comments 1": "This slide was triggered a few minutes before my party reached the saddle directly east of Little Superior.  The party of 2 at the saddle had seen it slide.  They said they thought it was naturally triggered. However, another party was above the slide skinning up (on the south side of Little Superior), and I suspect that it could have also been remotely triggered by them.  The winds were blowing about 20 to 30 m/h from the NNW onto the SE facing slope.  Winds were not very prevalent in most areas and were mostly confined to this area and summits.  The crown was about 18\" to 24\" deep.  It ran with several slabs of snow remaining on the slope, but also entrained snow.  Near the bottom of our descent on Two Trees, we observed a fresh debris pile that covered the tracks from yesterday.  We expect that it ran about 1300 vertical feet or more.  Time was a concern for my party so we did not investigate the slide further (hardness of the slab is an estimate). \n\nThe party that (may have) triggered the slide, were not caught and traversed SW across the south side of Little Superior.  We observed their tracks down the south facing nose of Little Superior.  The wind affected snow seemed very pockety and there were many absolutely tremendous options to ski down that were much safer.  \n\nObserver note: I counted about 30 headlamps at one time going up to Cardiff Pass and beyond.  Typical wasangles day.  It's important to pick routes carefully as well as be very observant and respectful about what and who is both above and below you.  ",

        "Comments 1": "While topping out on Suicide chute, the cornice and wind slab beneath it released, sending soft chunks down the slope and taking with it the new storm snow for the majority of the width of the chute. The slide ran the entire length of Suicide and stopped about 75-100 feet after the start of the Superior apron. Even though winds were well behaved on the apron and during the majority of the ascent, they were blowing fairly hard at the very top. The top 10 feet of the chute had a significantly slicker crust beneath the new snow than what we had encountered for the majority of the climb, making it difficult for us to set steps near the top. Given the slick crust at the top, its apparent the wind slab didn't need too much provocation to get moving.\nPhotos, which aren't the best quality, show part of the crown and then down the chute where you can see some remaining chunks left behind.",

We figured we could find some aspect that had not been hammered. We checked south and west facing areas and eventually settled on north facing trees, which skied well. On the way there though we triggered this very small slide from well over 200' away. The hairline cracking propagated over several hundred feet and grew in width to an inch or so.   The cracking started at the top of the first arrow and continued past the second. The whole set up was right out of the report today and slabs sensitive to body weight have clearly formed on above tree line leeward slopes.  The trick is that leeward seems to be about 2/3 of the compass, at least in this area. \n",

        "Comments 1": "We skied the NE facing Easter Bowl above Dutch Draw today. I performed 2 slope cuts with no results but felt thick/dense snow, probably from SW winds that blew overnight. Snow felt wind loaded in that particular zone with the recent 4-6\" of new snow that fell since yesterday. We were a bit suspicious and proceeded carefully.\n\n \n\nFirst and second skiers skied down with no issues. 3rd skier triggered a small wind slab pocket that propagated about 50' wide and ran about 100' long. Slow moving snow allowed skier to get out to safety easily (great reflex, he traversed and hid behind a tree). The small debris pile was not deep enough to burry a person but could have knocked you down easily.\n\n \n\nWe also skied West and East facing slopes through the day and did not encounter any other similar wind slabs. Just light fluffy dry powder everywhere else.\n\n \n\nThis was a small isolated pocket but I wonder how widespread the SW wind loading is out there.\n\nIf this had been loaded with more snow and had ran on a bigger slope it could have been a more serious slide.\n\nI will treat NE wind loaded slopes and gullies as suspect, especially with the new storm snow forecasted in the next 2 days that will cover them and make them harder to detect...\n\n \n",

The crown profile and dimensions above are for the avalanche on the lookers right of the slope.  It is possible that one avalanche initiated and sympathetically triggered the other.

The depth of the crown diminished along the left flank where there was less wind loading. \n\n \n\nThese avalanches most likely occurred on Wednesday 3/22 during the middle of a series of storms. The avalanche danger on 3/22 was rated HIGH. The snow started falling Sunday night into Monday 3/20 and by Wednesday the La Sals had received about 2 feet of snow and 2.6 - 3.0\" of SWE. Extreme winds out of the SW blew 50-70 mph Tuesday night and Wednesday. This slope was heavily wind loaded.

        "Comments 1": "I observed a large natural slab avalanche on the steep North-facing slope one cirque West of the Desolation Lake cirque (proper).  It is the steep ridge between powder park (3?) and the Desolation Lake drainage.  I would identify it precisely on google maps except I am unable to zoom to accurately indicate the slide's location.  I have tried 3 different computers and I'm giving up.  Anyway, the avalalanche is BIG; probably a  thousand feet wide, give or take.  The Eastern extremity is a well defined crown just below the West \"summit\" of the ridge feature and the fracture continues West and down to the Western extremity of the ridge.  It wraps around sub-ridges and connects slopes most people might consider \"unconnected\".  We did not investigate closely, but it ran full track, started as (at least) all the storm snow, and appeared to step down into older snow.  This is the same slope that killed Alan Murphy's brother in-law back in the early 80s.  \n\nObservation time was 5:00 pm. Based on this statement: \" Interestingly, no natural activity observed above Desolation Lake and West Desolation Ridge, which both have similar aspects to Sheep Sh!t Ridge -- perhaps not as much wind exposure in these locations?\"  made by SD earlier the same day, we might suppose this slide occured mid to late afternoon.  It certainly looked as \"fresh as a daisy\".  No camera, no pic.\n\nNote: Seth Dromgoole emailed the following comments:\nJust wanted to respond to Fred's Avy Observation of West Desolation and my Avy Obs of Sheep Shit Ridge (I'm SD) on 2/9/14.  I had noted in my Obs that I didn't see slides in Deso or West Deso -- I was in the area around 3-3:30 pm.  Fred stated he saw the slide around 5 pm.  The slide must have occurred in the 1.5 hr gap.  Of note, when I was scanning that area I did notice a lone skier skinning along the ridge between Deso and West Deso, perhaps that skier triggered the slide?",

As we got closer we could see this was a small but impressive glide Avalanche which fell into a pronounced gully used to access to the higher terrain in the western drainage. Upon our exit we were able to closely examine the slide. Photos show our first sighting, closer views on ascent, images at the toe of the slide.\n\nAs we progressed higher toward our planned decent we encountered wind effects on steep north facing slopes, 35-40 degrees, and encountered a pronounced collapse with a loud ripping report which sent me skinning backwards with my orifices puckered. My partner felt the collapse then experienced cracking as he was moving toward me.  We bailed on our objective at that point. Very interesting day for a low to moderate rated day. There were many red flags experienced during our tour. ",

Slide went down to the new snow/old snow interface. Given the steepness of that zone and the nearly 2 feet of pow up there, the slide picked up momentum and entrained enough snow to take people for a ride and perhaps cause a burial in a terrain trap. I made sure the slope below was clear of people before dropping in, there was no terrain trap below, and I expected the new snow might go, so everything worked out fine.

        "Comments 1": "Mark was out of town so we had to go to Cardiac Ridge oursleves on Friday.  Snow on the terrain ridden was about knee deep plus, inverted but nicely supportive for snowboards. Noteworthy was that there was a significant slide that occurred mid storm last week covering much of the width of cardiac ridge. There was enough new snow over the debris that the debris still rode well.  The slide seemed like it went slow and wide with debris height being only 1-1.5 feet above the rest of the snowpack at the lower portions.  All of the terrain in he photo slid other than the apron we rode and beneath the few moraines with scrubby trees in the area that aren't pictured. The terrain that did not slide has about 12-15\" of dense nice powder over maybe 6\" of lighter density-probably faceted snow.  It rode very well and no rocks were hit on the main slope. Some of this lower layer found up high and lower down was comprised of fine grained facets.\n\nHopefully the denser snow in the slide paths won't facet as thoroughly as it could have in the coming high pressure. Lower terrain was lively with lots rocks. Road down to BCC was mostly walk out at day's end and surely is all walking now.",

        "Comments 1": "The slide took place as party of 3 was ascending the Memorial #1 couloir on the backside of Mt. Olympus. As the first of the group reached the top of the couloir and the second person stepped out onto the slope, the slope collapsed with two people on it. The second was caught and carried 300 ft down the slope. He self arrested with verts and his poles and was on top of the snow uninjured when he came to a stop. HS-ASr-U-R2-D1.5-O\n\nLessons: We were at a lower elevation and in one of the outlying areas where the PWL is more present... The snow in the couloir felt stable on the ascent. As we approached the final roll to the top we did not re-group to discuss continuing. It was cold and shady in the couloir and the top looked like great views, sunny and warm. I have skied the couloir in the past and knew that the top always has the convex roll over from wind loading.  I was tricked because the stubborn hard  slab was capped with 6-8 inches of fresh snow on top.  Although it was convex and in retrospect was obviously wind loaded it did not feel slabby on top and the verts were punching through the new snow and it felt supportable. It did not seem like the same persistent slab that slid was present futher than 15 or 20 feet down the couloir.  We felt that the heavy windloading at the convex roll was what activated the layer. As soon as the second stepped onto the slope with the first on top of the slab, the increased load was enough to cause a collapse and take the second for a ride. \n\nLooking at the convex roll we should have skied from just below it and not have tried to push for the top of the couloir. Looking back, it was obviously wind loaded. The stoke was high as we could see the sun and the phenomenal powder. We should have SLOWED DOWN and better communicated our concerns. I'm glad my partner(s) are okay. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n",

        "Comments 1": "When I scanned the area of Cascade Face North and East of Rock Canyon Campground, I counted\n\nnine avalanches that had come down earlier this week.  Clearly a natural cycle triggered by multiple\n\ndays of increased heat and solar heating. \n\n \n\nFrom the West:\n\n \n\nA smaller avalanche West of  the Grr Couloir.  Not too big.  South aspect.  Fanned out, left a dirty\n\ndebris pile about 75' x 150'.\n\n \n\nThe Grr Couloir ran fully from the top at 10,000'.  South aspect.  Scoured deeply.  Left a rock\n\nledge about mid-way.  (bummer for the skiers) Left debris in the lower section.  Blasted across\n\nthe road leaving debris about 15' to 18'deep.  Fairly clean snow, smaller lumps.\n\n \n\nAnother smaller one above & to the West of the Foot.  Dropped out of some cliffs.\n\n \n\nCrows Foot Couloir.  This thing went totally psycho this time...  I could see two\n\nsections of  5'-6' Crown Fracture about 150' below the ridge.  One facing South,\n\nthe other due West. The debris shot out of the defile at the base of the Crows Foot\n\nwith very large chunks of muddy, damp, and hard snow.  It blasted through more\n\nof the previous debris over the road. It must have run quite a while.  I counted at\n\nleast 8 separate tracks.  Multiple tall vertical sided walls. More broken trees from\n\nabove.  The longest run went a full hundred yards further than the second\n\navalanche's.  Leaving a 30' wall stacked on the Second Left Hand trail.  The Toe is\n\nalmost to the base of the hill on the West side of the valley. (marker pin on map)\n\nBrutal, violent,and probably unnervingly loud for the duration. Did I mention\n\nreally dirty?  There used to be a forest of Maple, Box Elder, Aspen, and a few\n\npine.  Flattened better than a couple of Dozers with an anchor chain.\n\n \n\nSnowmobiles, Snow Bikes etc. won't be getting across or around for a while.\n\n \n\nNext the four open spaces East of the campground,  West aspect. The three larger ones\n\nran fairly big. With a plenty somewhat dirty debris.  None reached  the road. #4 was about\n\na third the size. All started high up near the top of the ridge.\n\n \n\nOn the south end of the face is a smaller, shallow damp run that ends above the\n\nmouth of Dry Fork.\n\n \n\nCrossing the dugways either side of  Second Right Hand overlook, there was a legit\n\nconcern of stepping  off the pack and having to deal with steep hard slab.  The West\n\none had a couple of places that had pulled out as if there was a glide going on.  Like\n\na little Bergschrund.  Sweet.\n",

Lower on the shoulder I told my partner to do a ski cut at a break over, and he got a sizable crown to go as well.  \nThe snow was pretty touchy up there.  \n\nAlta is closed for the season, and not doing control work, and the terrain should be treated no differently than other backcountry terrain.",

        "Comments 1": "Saw a total of two avalanches NE facing Rocky Point, the smaller one skiers left and the second larger slide came right off the top of Rocky Point started out about 40ft wide and propagated out to about 100 ft at it widest point. Crown was around 18 inches deep, and pretty much cleaned out the entire snow pack to the dirt quite always down the slope. Assuming it released naturally in the early AM, and they probably both released at the same time or one sympathetic the other.  There were no tracks in the area.   Slide obviously pulled out on the old faceted snow from a couple weeks ago, my thinking is that the wind and new snow overloaded the weak facets underneath.  Nice debris pile in the island of trees at the bottom, definitely would have ruined your day.

        "Comments 1": "There are some large cornices on the northern facing ridgeline on the back side of Flagstaff dropping into Two Dogs. While skinning along the ridge, one of the cornices broke without any assistance while two skiers passed by at what seemed like a perfectly safe distance from the edge (~4 feet). A huge chunk went down the hill and could have caused some serious damage/injury if anyone had been down below. It hit a couple of trees and split apart, but the largest chunk that made it all the way down was probably 6 feet long, 3 feet deep, and 3 feet wide. The fall triggered slough below, but it all seemed to be the top layer of the snowpack. There is still a fragile piece of the cornice that will likely fall soon (shown in the pictures).\n",

        "Comments 1": "We skinned up Slate Canyon on the afternoon of March 11. We were wary of this particular avalanche path given the recent rain, warming, and likely windloading off the top of Buckley. The debris deposit both from the most recent and previous avalanches was impressive. The debris pile was about 300 feet in length and looked to be 20+ feet deep in spots (hard to capture with pictures). It has completely wiped out the trail. The most recent debris ran full track down into the stream bed and some oven-size chunks of snow were visible. There was about an inch of snow over the debris, indicating that it avalanched the night of March 10 or early in the morning March 11, sometime before the snow subsided.\n\n \n\nFurther up-canyon, we dug a hasty pit at 7100' on an east-northeast facing slope. We found 1.5 meters of total snowpack. The top 20 or so inches of snow formed a thick, heavy cohesive slab and sat on loose, wet grains (maybe old facets that got soaked with the rain?). These grains were so loose that some would spill out as soon as we exposed them in the pit, and the cohesive slab on top was obvious while digging and with finger tests. Seems possible that the large debris pile we saw was the result of an avalanche that failed on this layer. Hard to say for sure. Upon seeing how cohesive the top slab of snow was and what it sat on, we proceeded carefully down the ridge we ascended. \n",

        "Comments 1": "We got home from riding this afternoon and pulled out the telescope to look for any recent avalanche activity on the front range.  We noticed several recent avalanches, probably ran yesterday during the warm temperatures.  Sorry for the poor photos.  \n\nThe first was this very large avalanche in the North Fork of Cherry Creek.  The slide started near the ridgeline at 9200 feet, was 1/4 to 1/2 mile wide, and ran down to 7400 feet.  The slopes involved faced South east to West and encompassed several pockets that released likely during the same event",
        "Comments 2": "One smaller slide was noticed in Smithfield canyon just South of the Grotto and North of Rocky Canyon.  The 50 foot wide slide started on a Northwest facing slope in the trees and ran at least 600 vertical.  ",

        "Comments 4": "There was another slide in the Cougar Peak vicinity.  last week most faces on Cougar peak avalanched big.  Yesterday a smaller pocket (50-70 ft) pulled out on a West facing sub ridge around 8400 feet.  We could not see the toe of the avalanche but it likely did not run more than 4-500 vertical feet",

        "Comments 1": "Poor visibilty for photo (annotation denotes crowns), but mid morning break in the storm allowed for a good look into the Pioneer Bowl area from the East Ridge of Pioneer. Definite crowns were observed just under steep cliffs to rider's right of the Main Chute. The entire rider's left wall from mid slope down off the North Ridge had connected pockets as well. They all appeared to have run possibly overnight during the high PI rates on 20191128 into 20191129. Along with these observations, there had also been activity in the Toilet Bowl area as well as the V-Tree Area. No crowns were able to be observed safely, yet hard slab debris chunks were observed in the lower runout zones as well as covering the uphill sides of trees. Of Note: Numerous and widespread loud thundering collapses were observed while traveling on the low angle northerly side of the East Ridge of Pioneer. See other photo. Also of note, numerous collapses were observed on the low angle S and SE aspects off the East Ridge. There appeared to be a 3 cm layer of October facets with a 2 cm m/f crust capping it, and the collapsing slab consisted of 1 finger to pencil hard new snow that had been stiffened up by the upslope southerly winds.\n",

        "Comments 1": "Came across this in our travels today.  This area is a repeater, the usual suspect, ENE facing, exposed, wind stripped, shallow pack, and very rocky.  Side by Side naturals occurred overnight or during yesterdays wind event that accompanied weak cold front.  We were really surprised to see any activity, and while is was very fresh, our objective was across the valley, NW facing, more sheltered, and certainly the fattest snowpack in the area. \n\nLooking on the fetch to the south, a significant row of trees may be a catalyst for this path, slowing the snow so it loaded on this steep rocky gullies ,  and while several other exposed ridgelines had been blown to the dirt from SW winds, that was not the case here.  This is the only activity we saw all day long, where we skiied is included in our ob. \n\nObviously faceting in the rocks is the weak layer, the pictures tell it all.  Recent wind loading yesterday and overnight, failed on facets in rocky shallow area. \n\nFORECASTER COMMENTS:  Darce is on it here.  I've noted numerous areas where the wind has stripped the snow creating a shallow snowpack that is much weaker than the deeper areas.  This is tricky as these shallow areas become buried and there are no obvious signs that they are holding a shallow and weak snowpack under the newer snow.  The only way is to follow certain slopes throughout the winter so you know what the structure is and how it progresses.  Otherwise, it's a 'crap shoot'.  I am also a bit surprised to see natural activity but the winds no doubt picked up enough to transports snow on Sunday.\n",

        "Comments 1": "I think everyone who reads this should know I screwed up.  I intentionally triggered a soft slab in the very southernmost part of Toledo Bowl, from the peak in the chute that runs about 1000 vertical in a due east direction.  I was quite surprised by how far it ran, and I think if someone had been below me but out of sight this slide could have been a big problem for them.  I knew know one was there as I had put in the skin track to the peak.  I knew this chute was going to move but I was quite surprised how fast and how far it went.  I generally try not to be surprised in the backcountry, and I am mad when I get surprised.  I think this chute was far more windloaded and denser than I would have guessed from my previous runs in main and banana days on similar aspects.  I did have a very small soft slab release at the bottom of main days on a very steep (>45 degrees) aspect, but it was totally manageable and expected.  I think this slide surprised me because of how predictable things had been over in days fork.  I forgot my camera so there are no pics.  (first trip of the season, I was lucky I remembered the beacon).  It did pull out parts of the chute that were not directly in the slide path in a sort of sympathetic fashion.  The bed surface was pretty soft, not a hard suncrust.",

I don't know very much about it except that the crown goes all the way from cardiac pass to the cardiac ridge run and then there is another crown lower down at the roll over. we observed the aftermath a little before noon on Feb 14 so it happened sometime before then.\n\nForecaster comments:\nI took additional photos on February 15th.  The avalanche broke from Cardiac Pass to the steep rock slabs down canyon.  Total width was estimated to be 1000' with a fracture depth estimated to be 5-6 feet.  As it descended, it pulled out the lower slopes on Little Superior down by the bottom of the basin at about the same depth and width.  I did not get to examine the fracture line but it was obvious from looking at it that it was a deep slab running on the weak depth hoar and faceted snow layers deep in the snowpack.\n\nThe first photo is an overall wide view of the upper and lower fracture lines.\nBruce Tremper\n",

        "Comments 1": "This report is being submitted vicariously for another party, in case it is not reported directly. Wind was the story today in upper LCC. Though the wind was blowing out of the S/SW, most of the high terrain was subject to some combination of wind scouring and cross loading of hard wind slabs due to eddying and convective upcanyon winds meeting the upper level winds. My partner and I were headed for the coalpit headwall, but after climbing and skiing the Hogum Hobgack and looking up the Hypodermic Needle, we were not convinced topping out would be feasible. Snow whirls were eddying up the chute and snow was pluming off the top of the headwall. \"Let's head partway up and assess.\"\nAs we started up the bottom of the hypo, one party ahead of us head already topped out and another party was near the top. One quarter of way up the ascent, wind slab avalanche debris from a moderate sized slide came down the needle at us. My partner Mike made a quick move to ski down and out of the way. Shortly after, a party of 3 skied down to us. The first skier reported that even though the snow surface had seemed like bulletproof wind slab on the ascent, he had triggered a slightly softer wind slab on the descent on the skiers right (leeward side of cliffband). The slide carried him 300' and he went under at one point but ended up on top. The slide ran about 600' total and was not huge, but certainly enough to bury a person (pic 1).\nWe all decided to bail and head down Hogum Fork. On the way down, in the bottom of the drainage, I ski cut a small but steep rollover in otherwise benign terrain that released a wind slab up to 3' deep (pic 2).",

I give credit to my wife for noticing what I thought was an optical illusion (turned out to be the main crown line off Thurston Peak) otherwise we wouldn't have made this discovery! I'm unsure as to when the cycle happened but judging by the nature of the deposition piles that we could spot, I would place them in the wet slab or wet loose and cornice release and likely the middle to end of this last week during the rain event and or the green housing and warming. In our investigation we counted 10-15 crown lines that may be connected from ridge line to ridge line and the large majority were on the middle 2/3 of main ridge, initiating on the northerly & northwesterly aspects of the westerly running sub ridges. There are so many avalanches over such similar terrain and short piece of the range  I opted to lump these all in to one observation so to save some time.

        "Comments 1": "We went to investigate an avalanche that we spotted from afar. Guessing it occurred sometime between January 29th & 31st. There were many snowmobile tracks on the slope around so we are guessing it was snowmobile triggered. We turned our beacons to search and found no signal. This avalanche was interesting because it started sliding on a layer 55cm above the ground and then stepped down to the ground. The crown varied between 2 & 4 feet deep and filled the gully at the bottom completely. Wish we knew the whole story, hope everyone involved is okay. [Forecaster Comments: Thanks for submitting this observation. Always a good idea to do a beacon search when coming across fresh debris for a slide that hasn't yet been reported.]\n",

The avalanche was 300 ft wide 2-3 ft deep and ran pretty far taking out a few tracks from yesterday. \nNot sure if this avalanche was a natural or triggered remotely by the party that pushed the up track up the head wall early this morning. Possibly this was the party that was caught in a avalanche in West Porter area. This was not the avalanche that caught and buried someone one I think. The avalanche that I took a picture of might be the slide the party was caught in but, I searched the bed surface looking for tracks and also looked up at the crown and saw no tracks. However, this is all speculation on my part.",

In the forecast this morning Drew mentioned to be wise in terrain choices and the best tool for avoiding avalanches is to stay off slopes approaching 32 degrees and steeper. This up track went straight up the head wall on a slope that was easily steeper than 35 degrees and was loaded up with plenty of new snow.\nI also saw many other backcountry travelers punching lines steeper than 35 degrees and it was a miracle that only one person took a ride.

        "Comments 1": "\n\t \n\n\tThe incident began when an 18-year-old rider triggered a small avalanche (most likely a wet sluff) as he descended a steep slope and was taken for a ride.  He lost control of his sled as it flipped over a few times and ended up buried to the handlebars in a gully. The rider was partially buried nearby and was able to self extricate.  A second rider rode his sled down the slope and assisted the first.\n\n\t \n\n\tAccording to information gathered from the father of the second rider, the avalanche was only a small part of the ordeal.   It turns out the pair had descended into a steep ravine that bottomed out in cliffs above the rock quarry at the head of the canyon.  They could not get down due to the cliffs below and they couldn't get back up the steep gully they had descended. \n\n\t \n\n\tTrapped by the terrain, the pair became exhausted recovering the sled and trying to get back up and out of the bottomless ravine. They called friends for help in the evening and eventually made it out of the canyon after a long night on the mountain...\n \n",

        "Comments 1": "Just to add to the reports from yesterday.  We found very sensitive new-snow slab conditions, with a density inversion the weak layer.  Weather was windy and snowing hard, just above freezing, with poor visibility.  On way up to Cardiff Pass two Alta Ski Patrolmen skied by, and told us that they had just triggered east-facing Cardiff Peak.  Continuing up, we passed a slide that was about 200 yards across, at a mid-slope rollover next to the trail, triggered by a skier.  When we got within sight, the Cardiff Peak slide was wall-to-wall.  These slides did not run very far over lower-angle terrain, nor pile up too deeply, but the snow was heavy and it would not have been fun to be caught by one of these, or end up in a gully (like the one under Toledo Bowl.)  From Cardiff Pass we saw that the east side of the ridge that separates East and West Cardiff had slid, we believe naturally, again wall-to-wall.  Two of us skied back to Alta, another two entered Cardiff Fork.  Later they told us that Cardiac Ridge had slid wall-to-wall, as well as another steep slope along the ridge between the weather station and LSB.  Sorry we got no photos, as light was very poor.",

        "Comments 1": "When I got to cardiff pass I could large avy activity, the largest crown I saw was below the steep freeride lines of cardiac ridge, the crown seem connected from cardiac pass all the way to cardiac ridge proper, where people do typically ski.  I saw another crown on LSB on the skiers left side in the trees and lower down on the E facing terrain.  I could not tell if the entire slab/crown was connected through cardiac bowl because of poor visibility.  I do not typically share my findings on the internet but this seemed to good not to share.  After checking out crowns on culps, dougs drop and many other places over the last few days this activity in Cardiff seemed by far the largest, most destructive and well connected slab I have seen.  Pictures are not epic, I only have my cell phone.  Two pics of caridac ridge crown, one of LSB more N facing terrain.    ",

        "Comments 1": "We started up Main Porter Fork. It was raining bellow about 7600'.    Lots of cornice building and wind loading on the ridge from Sox's to Ice Box.  We noted evidence of one natural avalanche from the ridge on a NE facing slope. We picked our way into Ice Box through low angle terrain.  Hand pits away from ridge line at 11:00 AM did not indicate propagation through the slab.  However ski cuts on a somewhat loaded test slope off of the ridge line produced a long running 12\" deep x 15' wide SS on the 4th ski cut.  \n\nWinds off the ridge line were variable and decreased in the afternoon.  We noted increasing PI throughout the day and the skinner was filling back in rapidly.  No collapsing or shooting cracks.  Hand pits showed increasing sensitivity and slab formation through the afternoon.  We picked our way up Main Porter Fork on low angle terrain to drop into West Porter Fork.  \n\nJust past the saddle with West Porter Fork person breaking trail initiated a kick turn to avoid a steeper open slope.  The slope collapsed and cracks shot out and propagated up the adjacent slope 100' above him.  The slab was about 10\" deep and 60' wide and slid right past his ski tips.  The slab ran with considerable energy about 300' down into small trees.  Measured slope of skin track where initiated was 33* (steeper than we thought).  Adjacent avalanche path was estimated at 35* steepening to 38*.   \n\nPhone was dead so no pictures.  \n",

Figured that the Key Hole would probably avalanche too, entered on skiers right and about 25ft off the ridge the slope fractured and propagated out about 30 or 40ft. The crown was from 10 to 12 inches in depth and the debris ran about 300-400ft. Not much of a surprise it pulled out, the clues were all there, recent avalanches, wind loading, and new snow not bonding well to the old surface.\n",

        "Comments 1": "I observed this avalanche in West Bowl on Saturday, 1/23/16, but I do not know exactly when it occurred.   The location is about half way between the top of West Bowl and Davenport Hill. It would appear to have been sometime between Thursday and Saturday.  Everything about this avalanche is my estimation, and could be incorrect.  However, I think it is important to have a record of it, as it looks like a \"repeater\".  It ran to the rocky ground in the upper starting zone, but the relatively small deposition suggests it wasn't the whole snowpack, so I infer that this path has run one or more times before and reloaded with wind deposition from the south side of the ridge.  The other interesting thing about this slide is how far visible crowns extend out and down the hill.  This is a very large area through which the fracture propagated, or triggered the other mid-slope avalanches sympathetically.  Either way, it speaks to the presence of weak snow underlying this particular area.  \n\nIt should be noted that if this area refills during the next storm or wind event, another avalanche is very likely.  \n\nIn the picture, I have outlined the visible crowns in red.\n",

About 2.7 miles from the parking lot they started to divert off the main trail and ascend toward a ridge. They were making switchbacks up a slope when they triggered an avalanche. The avalanche propagated about 300 feet above them. One skier was able to grab a tree and avoid taking the ride which the other skier did. He took about a 300 foot ride and was strained through some aspens and completely buried near the toe. His partner who did not go for a ride located him with an avalanche transceiver and dug him out from under about 4 feet of snow. He was uninjured and they were able to return to the parking lot on their own.",

        "Comments 1": "Wanted to scout new lines for after the storm and when stability was more consistent.  Approached area cautiously as it could have been forming cornice.  New area - so unknown.  Probed and patted as I came near edge for possible cornice concerns.  Group was not exposed - only I was.  Was able to safely make way out to evaluate conditions and possible future lines.  Spent a few minutes observing lines and weather while looking for safest selection of terrain for a splitboard/AT skin track route that would take us back to the top of the ridge after the decent for future ski.  Could not see cornice - except for formations of a few further down the ridge.  Walked back to safe zone to grab camera and give findings to group.  Went back out on same book pack still cautiously for another look.  While beginning to leave - massive propagation stretched the entire east facing ridge (looking out towards Fairview Lakes). Propagation connected to a SE facing ridge and set off slide of entire aspect.  I am still hesitant to say it was 100% cornice as everything acted in slab nature, but logic tells me slight cornice formation maybe on top of unstable slope causing slab like nature to cornice area.  Smaller propagation covered the entire face below me.  Had group throw my cornice cutting rope to me as I was surrounded by huge cracks and was afraid to move - tied back in and pulled to safety.  Earlier that day: Spent the previous hours digging pits and beacon practices before this event.  Found CT 14s scattered around and CT 23's.  Also found a few CT 3's and 12s where winds were blowing.  All CTs were on east facing slopes.  Did note that we were getting very different readings all over east facing slopes - pending on wind exposure. .   Glad to ski another day.  Hope this can help others in the Sanpete area.  -Sean Busby",

I’m going with persistent weak layer because it instantly stepped down to the facets at the ground. I only inspected the slide lower on the slope and it initially started in a thin rocky steep area where the crown was only a foot deep, but it pulled out to the ground leaving a 2 foot crown in the deepest part. The new snow cleaned out and ran a good ways on the flats but it left the 5 to 8 inches of faceted snow in the bed surface. Conditions were full on at this point and I didn’t inspect the slide off the peak.  No one was in the area, and only took a small disturbance on the slope to produce remotely triggered avalanches\n",

It broke about 50' above me and luckily the slab stayed together long enough for me to ski 30' or so off of it while it was moving. The crown didn't look that large but the size and power of the debris makes me think it was at least 18-24\" deep in some places. It ran 300-400' vertical feet. I think I'm lucky to have skied off it and that my partner wasn't caught, since in hindsight we weren't spaced out as far as we should have been. We should have had our guard up more today given all of the strong winds from various directions over the last several days. \n",

        "Comments 1": "Later in the day, on my last run, I triggered this hard wind slab that formed as a result of the last storm cycle.  I didn't know it has slid until skinning back up which indicates to me that I triggered it from down below and it pulled up before failing at which point I was off.  It ran on the new snow old snow interface. I found a pencil to one finger hard layer that formed during the beginning of the last storm cycle.  On top of that was a one finger hard wind slab and what appeared and felt like small grained facets between the wet and cold layers however I didn't take pics of crystals to verify.  This was all new wind slab and no old snow pulled out.  Just a few feet away from the slide, and off the slab, I found blower light power on top of our rain /wet snow layer that formed at the beginning of the last storm.  Unrelated to the slide, I found noticeable basal facets up to 8 cm thick at the ground interface.\n\nAdded Notes:  I ran into a group and they asked me when the slide occurred before I had skied it.  I didn't see any evidence of a slide or crown at that point but the light was a little flat at that point and they had come form another vantage point than myself.  I did notice that on Friday someone had put an up track in the middle of the slope adjacent to the slide within 100 feet of the skiers right flank.  Also when investigating, I noticed part of the crown closer to the skin track was filled in more than I suspected.  I even dug around a little to see how fresh the snow was below the crown and judging by the density of the new blown in snow it seemed like that section of the crown could have been from day before.  I suspect the skinner remote triggered the slide just as I did at the bottom of my run.  Looking at the very last pick we see the second slide pulled even closer to the skin track.  The swatch of the slope was clean where I had skied and as you can see in the second to last pic the runout is centered on my tracks.\n",

We skied the west face of Patsey Marley below the microwave tower back into Alta. About half way down we put in a ski cut on top of the steep rollover. Based on what we'd seen with our test slopes we figured it would probably go. The slab consisted of new snow only, didn't run with too much energy, and was completely manageable. Poor vis made for a poor photo. We did call Alta Central, as the sun had peeked out by the time we got back to the car and you could see the slide from the parking lot.",

As the first skinner moved up and right to gain the ridge, he collapsed the newly formed wind slab (in the lee of the north/northwest ridge) above the faceted grains and it pulled out 10' above him. \nNever caught how far he was carried, but he relayed that he was wrapped around a tree, lost a ski and suffered two broken ribs and a fractured tibial plateau. The two were able to self-evac with significant self-reliance and suffering. \nBy the individual caught, carried and injured - \n\"A bit of a rough ride after triggering a slide on the up track nearing the top of Mt Aire. Thankfully aside from some injuries all is well. The failure occurred on the new snow/old snow interface with wind loading being the culprit of the new snow. Even though the majority of the loading was happening on the south facing slopes enough had loaded to from a 6\" slab that broke free about 10 feet above me. The fracture followed the ridge down for an undetermined distance. Just goes to show to that even some loading with no new snow can get things moving especially on solid crust.

Hard slabs have the propensity to pull out above you when you've perhaps collapsed a thinner part of the slab onto the failure plane below. This seems to have been the case as the two were skinning up the slope and moving into the thinner part of the 'lens' of hard slab. Heading up and into the slab, having it break above you, and skinning doesn't give you much of a chance to escape. Fortunately, the two were spread out enough so that only one was caught. ",

It wasn't until we got closer to the site that we realized just how big this avalanche was. The terrain isn't extreme, slope angles average 35 degrees, though there is a 37 degree mid slope breakover. The scary deal here is the slide pulled snow out along a low angle ridge which only measured 22 degrees in slope angle. In addition to this large avalanche, you can see another pocket in the foreground which broke sympathetically.

        "Comments 3": "If you were near these trees watching your partner climb the slope, you'd have no place to run. Avalanches triggered on surface hoar are particularly tricky because they break very wide and can connect to low angle slopes we think are safe. ",
        "Comments 4": "Since this slide wasn't reported to us and no tracks entered or exited the debris, we can only speculate the avalanche was remotely triggered. Occurring on an East-Northeast facing aspect at about 10,200' the avalanche broke on preserved surface hoar. The crown face measured 2.5'-4' deep and was about 600' wide, but due to a terrain trap only ran 200' vertically into a terrain trap.",

The Glide avalanche came of the rock shield about 3\\4 of the way up Bonkers an on the skiers left side while ascending. Debris ran down to where the slope flattens out.

I'm curious if anyone has any information about the slide, or if it was a natural.  I thought this would be a helpful addition to the last week of persistent slabs we've been having.  You can see in the pictures it started right below the Sundial, and continued almost to the base of the gully just a couple hundred feet above the height of the lake.\nForecaster Comments: Added date of 1 Feb to keep it within the queue...overall date of release unknown.\n",

The timing is uncertain. \n\n\n\nArm chair observation from the office in downtown Orem. Spotted this with the naked eye in the late afternoon (first photo). Photo is taken with a phone up to a binocular scope. I am guessing it started as a wet slide that then stepped down to a weak layer and then broke across the slope about a quarter mile wide. Estimating at least 5ft deep based off of how easy it is to spot. On the ridgeline just south of the north summit of Timp. Also saw some other wet slides on the south end of timp off of the cliffs (second photo). Similar wet slides also observed on the south end of Cascade (SW facing aspects) earlier this weekend. So it could be that the massive slide broke off a couple days ago.\n",

Two of us had finished riding the line. The last member of the party was in the last bit of the couloir (below the tight section) when we noticed a powder cloud shoot up. Last party member rode quickly and exited before the debris stopped in the upper apron. I spoke with another party who rode the line and the avalanche had covered most of our tracks, and the avalanche had come off the East facing slopes above the couloir. Had we been 15 minutes slower, we may have had an Aaron Rice experience.

        "Comments 1": "When skinning up to Manns, I observed a large slide down the SW face of Tomosaki.  The slide appeared to have naturaled after the end of the last snow fell. My best guess is Sunday when the sun came out.  The debris had no new snow on it.  The debris pile was quite large and the storm slab had pulled out all the old snow most of the way down.  The debris was very close to the summer trail at the bottom and if caught would certainly have buried and possibly killed someone as they got drug over the ground surface.  This was an eye opener and was an obvious indicator to stay off steep south facing wind effected slopes.\nI dug a pit higher up the drainage below Manns at about 11,800 just below the tree line facing south.  New snow depth was about 10 inches.  HS 160 CTN, moderate shovel sheer pulled out about 2 feet of snow on a very thin weak layer ( 1 cm thick ) of buried near surface facets.\nThe snow has filled in very nicely in the La Sals (180 cm in sheltered terrain) however much of the alpine has been scoured clean, the tree line and lower is deep and quality is very high.  I expect the sun to have it's way with the snow today and begin our first corn cycle.  I expect the steep south slopes to off limits mid-day as the sun bakes the snow into wet mush.\n",

Elevation: 9277'\nSlope Angle in Gully: 37 deg. \n\nAspect: 182 deg. \n\nGully off of Binx's Ridge, LCC\n\n\nMyself, Sean T., and two friends were skiing Emma Ridge / Binx's Ridge on the afternoon of  12.27.2021. We had discussed the dangers of wind loading, wind slabs, and wind pockets before starting out. We observed a relatively stable snow pack on the approach, except for a few quick pole punch tests where we observed a quickly accumulating wind slab on some slopes. We reached the ridge in about 35 minutes, and immediately noticed large cornicing and wind loading on top of the ridge line. We again discussed the dangers of wind-loading, skiing leeward slopes, terrain traps, and proceeded with caution. We transitioned at the top of Emma Ridge (10200 elev.) and the first skier dropped onto the slope. Giving each other adequate and safe space, we each dropped the slope. At aprox. 15:23 the first skier remotely triggered a wind slab that had accumulated in a gully off of the ridge, which is well known for sliding. This terrain trap was identified by all members of the party. When the entire team reached the island of safety, established by the first skier, the first skier stated how he had skied up to the edge of the gully, watched shooting cracks propagate beneath him, and immediately skied away. The second and third skiers identified the approximate depth of the slab to be between 16\"-20\".\n\n \n\nAll members of the party made it off the mountain safely and without incident. \n\nBC skiers be warned! Emma and Binx's ridges are relatively safe, considering the snow pack, but there are many terrain traps surrounding those areas. Proceed with caution, be aware on the uphill and downhill, and do not be folly to the potential wind slabs that are accumulating through the rest of this storm cycle. High winds and heavy snow fall are contributing to these dangerous conditions. \n",

        "Comments 1": "After a friend and I had climbed this hill about ten different times my friend placed a track about ten feet above our last highmark.  He sidehilled across the slope and was just about to turn downhill when the avalanche broke loose.  At that moment my friend made a quick last minute decision and turned his sled uphill and got stuck right where the crown broke.  The crown face was between 2' and 3' and it appeared to be a pillow of wind loaded snow that ran on the rain crust.  In the picture you can see previous tracks we placed on left side of the field.  The track going through the middle of the debris pile is from my friend descending after he dug his sled out.\n\nWe also observed another slide later in the day.  Earlier I drop off a cornice \ninto a chute of sorts with nothing more than some loose snow sluffing.  Later we \ntraveled along that ridge and as we passed the same place I went off earlier a \npiece of cornice broke off and triggered an avalanche.  The aspect was very \nsimiliar to the one I reported, but maybe a little smaller of a slide.  Here are \nthe coordinates I got off google maps, I am not sure the \nformat 40.548961-111.568394 (it is west and slightly north of the slide I \nreported)\nThanks to you and all the of the forecaster, you all do a great job.  I read the \nreport just about everyday and try to pick my routes or the hills we may climb \naccordingly. \n\n ",
        "Comments 2": "There was one portion of the slide that did break through the January rain crust which was quite stout and about 1 inch thick. This was on the lookers right side of the slide where the avalanche fractured in the trees. Faceted snow below the crust was the weakness. You can see the facets and the crust a few inches above the bed surface in this photo. The facets were not particularly alarming and it was difficult to reproduce shears with tests here. This portion of the slope was 48 degrees in steepness.",
        "Comments 3": "Here is the other pocket that Mr Miller reported. It was on the north aspect of the main Ant Knolls. I did not climb down in to check it out. The stout crust not too far under the surface was too intimidating for me to get on this very steep terrain.",
        "Comments 4": "Forecaster Comments:\nKobernik\nThis was a significant avalanche. Mr Miller's assessment was correct in my opinion. It was a recent windload which failed just above the January rain crust. There was no significant weakness directly above the crust. It was difficult to get this weakness to fail in shear tests. The rapid addition of weight from the wind transported snow seemed to be the biggest factor. I suspect that if this slope were left alone for another 24 hours to give the fresh wind load a little more time to settle it probably wouldn't have avalanched.\nI tip my hat to these guys for checking out the crown and trying to figure out what was going on with the layering. Our sled community is becoming more savvy as the years go on and it's great to see!!",

        "Comments 1": "While hiking the Broads Fork trail I noted several avalanches that had occurred off the east facing slopes.  As you know, these areas commonly run throughout the winter and this year was no exception.  As I hiked further, this large slide came into my view. It had entrained a significant amount of snow and was easily several hundred yards wide at its terminus.  The avalanche was also choked with large chunks of ice/snow and was perhaps 6-7 feet deep in most spots w/some areas up to 10 feet deep further up the avy's path.  The avalanche date of May 5th is an estimate but seemed to match reasonably well with the snows appearance and previous weather conditions...although could have been w/in the past two weeks.  The pics below show the slides full path and also looking up/across the avalanches impressive mass. \n\nForecasters note: from looking at the photos, the avalanche could be more recent than May 5.  It could have occurred during the very warm period on Monday or Tuesday the 13th or 14th.  With these glide avalanches it's hard to tell since they come down quite randomly.   Tremper",

        "Comments 1": "Early this morning I triggered a deep wind slab off the NE face of Lone Peak. In hindsight it is incredibly obvious that we had no business being there, but I will list out thoughts and details below.\n\n \n\nBack in February my partner and I planned a linkup connecting Alpine to BCC. We discussed logistics and had the details ironed out, however we never ended up completing it. Fast forward to last weekend- I saw a favorable forecast with lower temps and reached out to my partner. We decided that this would be our last chance of the season to complete this objective, so we planned accordingly.  At this time forecasts predicted 1-2\" of snow at upper elevations with moderate winds. We decided that this wouldn't be too large of a factor but we would need to be heads up for wind slabs as always. \n\n \n\nOver the course of the week, the forecast was upgraded to predict strong NW winds and up to 14\" of snow at 10,000. We discussed this at length and decided to make a game time decision- if more than 6\" of snow or sustained winds over 30 were reported by 1930 4/21, we would bail. Come yesterday evening winds of 30mph and 5\" of snow were reported. Despite this being very close to the cutoff we has discussed, we decided to continue ahead.\n\n \n\nWe began from Alpine this morning and summitted Lone Peak at 0530. It was dark, very windy and a cloud sat on the upper ~700 feet of the mountain limiting visibility to less than 10 feet. We immediately bailed on the NE couloir and skied down the ridge a few hundred feet to escape the high gusts. At this point we decided to ski a small chute that drops into upper bells so we could continue with the rest of our linkup. We planned to ski this chute relatively close to one another given the low visibility. I skied first and found what looked to be a meager island on the skiers right side of the chute. I gave the okay for my partner to ski skiers left then make his way over to me. As he got within 5 feet of me, a wind slab broke 3-4' deep at his feet and carried me. I was immediately knocked off my feet but was able to arrest after 50-75 feet. We skied the path down and decided to bail.\n\n \n\nI think that the largest error I made was feeling \"safe\" after bailing on our objective, NE Lone. We decided that it was inherently too risky, however what we ended up skiing was really no different. While it didn't have the exposed entrance and exit, it was the same aspect, elevation and certainly steep enough to avalanche. \n\n \n\nThe wind slab that failed was not apparent. It is not surprising that one had developed, however I did not expect it to connect so deep given the low storm totals. This was another error. I grossly underestimated wind loading potential.\n\n \n\nThe last contributing downfall was my objective-oriented decision making. I knew that this was likely the last opportunity for this goal this season and it affected my decision making. I let plans supersede safe decisions.\n\n \n\nGiven the combination of darkness, poor visibility, high winds + new snow, the right decision was to ski back to the car and get breakfast. I  was incredibly humbled, and am grateful to be physically uninjured.\n",

        "Comments 1": "Out for a nice christmas day tour with a group of four.  Skied an excellent lap of hero-snow in East-Bowl, then headed up West-Bowl to poke into Hideaway Park.  We dug a pit in the top of Hideaway Park and received mixed signals from the snowpack after three compression tests and three extended column tests.  We recognized our weak layer as well developed facets (mid-november cold snap NSF) ~30cm from the surface with a well-bonded slab (made up of the pre-christmas rime/snow/graupel events) above it.  We decided that we felt safe moving along the lower-angle shoulder, expected the possibility of manageable avalanching, and ensured there was no one below before ski-cutting our shoulder.  After a few cuts and during some safe-spot to safe-spot skiing one of our skiers (third to ski the slope) triggered and skied off a pocket on the more westerly slope of the shoulder that popped ~50' wide x18\" deep and ran ~200' downslope.  I then skied (safe-spot to safe-spot) the shoulder's more northern and mellow slope and triggered a larger pocket that popped ~50' wide x 18\" deep and ran ~600' (full track).  The second slide sympathetically released a small pocket in the trees next to it as it moved slowly down slope.  Both ran near the ground on old November facets (buried deep) and left evidence in their bed surface of the buried dirt layer from earlier this fall.  No one was caught in either slide and our party felt confident with the decisions we had made and the results of our actions.  We recognized that the avalanches had re-confirmed our assumptions about our mixed pit findings as well as the persistent slab problem we are experiencing in the Wasatch.",

Thinking maybe a natural from the period of North winds during the last storm. Guessing based on my pit today that the failure was on the interface of the heavy wet snow and the drier snow from after the cold front passage on Friday, or possibly some NSF from prior to the storm. Tough to really tell from across the way. Graupel seemed to be a player in the failure planes in my pit. This slide released directly underneath the White Cliffs and took out all of Martha's Bowl underneath Double Dogleg, running down into the choke above the lake.

He was dead when rescue crews got to him. Weather conditions, including wind gusts up to 75 mph, prevented efforts to remove the body. Crews left markers and will attempt to remove the body Sunday if conditions improve.\n\n \n\nSuzanne Tremblay, also in her 20s, was seriously injured in the slide, Salt Lake County Sheriff's Lt. Steven Chard said. She was in stable condition at Alta View Hospital late Saturday.\n\n\"She's doing OK,\" a nursing supervisor said. \"We just want to watch her for 12 to 24 hours to make sure.\"\n\n \n\nThe two were snowboarding with two other men and a woman when the avalanche started about 12:30 p.m., Chard said. The group was descending Mount Baldy at Snowbird when about 500 vertical feet of snow broke loose and swept up the snow-boarders as the avalanche rushed down the mountain of cliffs and exposed rocks.\n\n \n\nThe falling snow \"It was awfully lucky for any of them to survive,\" Sheriff's Lt. Lane Larkin said.\n\n \n\nTwo of the snowboarders were not completely buried and were able to dig themselves free, Larkin said. They made it to a lodge at Snowbird and called for help.\n\n \n\nThe other snowboarders were identified as Justin E. Kihell, Sean Mceeigh and Nicole Auletta. The five apparently moved to Utah from the East Coast about a month ago, authorities said.\n\n \n\nThe snowboarders started out at the Alta ski resort and made their way to Snowbird. The group ignored no trespassing signs and posted warnings of avalanche danger as they hiked into Snowbird, Chard said.\n\n \n\nNeither resort is open, so no avalanche control has been done. Authorities are urging recreationists to stay away from the slopes - calling conditions \"extremely dangerous\" - until the resorts open.\n\n\n ",

Jeff Clement, 21, was snowboarding with four friends in Little Cottonwood Canyon, between the Alta and Snowbird ski areas, when the incident occurred.\n\n\"It was reported that he was the last to start down and he's the one who broke it loose,\" Captain Gil Howard, of the Salt Lake Country Sheriff's Office, said. \"It was a way unstable area.\n\n\n\n\"The problem was they were in a ski area, but they were faced with backcountry conditions...\"\n— Sgt. Gil Howard, Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office\n\n\n\n \n\n\"All five were buried to one extent or another,\" Howard said, \"and he was the only one completely buried.\" The other four were able to extract themselves, but Clement was buried with his board uphill. Carrying no beacons or shovels, the friends reportedly did everything they could to locate Clement but were unsuccessful.\n\n \n\nClement's body was found at approximately 2 p.m. Saturday by an Alta rescue dog, but a heavy storm predicted for the area Saturday night forced rescuers to abandon the recovery effort.\n\nReturning Sunday during snows, rescuers \"shocked the mountain\" to release unstable snow and safely removed the body. Clement was originally buried under three feet of snow. Though not officially determined, Howard said, it appeared Clement may have died from severe head trauma\n\n \n\n\"The problem was they were in a ski area, but they were faced with backcountry conditions. They are lulled into a false sense, but there's no control work done and this is the tragic outcome,\" Howard said. Howard said he has heard there were upwards of 50 people in the area that day. Clement and his friends 'were just in the wrong area on the wrong day and at the wrong time,\" he said.\n\n \n\nA female member of the group was transported to Alta View hospital after the accident but has since been released. The other three snowboarders were not seriously injured.\n\nHoward said the five friends had hiked the ridgeline from Alta ski area onto Mt. Baldy. Not yet open for the season, the upper mountain, Howard said, is a popular pre-season destination for adventurous skiers and snowboarders. But, without any controls yet done on the mountain, avalanche danger was extremely high and the fact that the area is closed is well posted.\n\n \n\n\"They had to hike quite a bit to get up there,\" Howard said, \"but it's not atypical. It's a hard way to learn, but if we can prevent it from happening again, then there's a small amount of good that comes from it.\" Howard said it is imperative people learn about snow conditions and snow safety, as well as carry emergency equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Snowy Torrents narrative below has been provided courtesy of the American Avalanche Association.

Skier reported seeing skin track and 5 new tracks on the slope before he skied.  After skiing past the convexity he triggered the slide and was able to escape to safety on skiers left, 200' below the crown.  Had he been caught (or had the slide pulled out on the skinning party), results could have included battery on trees in the choke, or burial in the 2.5 meter debris pile.  \nToe of debris ran well onto flat ground, at 26 degrees from the crown.\nWhat caused the avalanche to pull out on the skier yesterday afternoon and not on the earlier party is a tantalizing mystery!",

        "Comments 1": "I arrived at Rock Canyon Campground around noon on Sunday.  I heard a couple of short slide rushes just before 1pm.  I assumed they were\nto the East up Dry Fork.  At 1:25 there was an extended sound with boulders included.  At 1:35 there was a second long one.  Location and altitude are estimated based on direct and reflected sound, and position of the sun.\n\nI could see a limited number of fresh point release/small rollers & a single short avalanche with minimal entrainment in Burnt Hollow around 8200'.\n\nIt felt like 45 degrees and I assume that all of these were influenced by local terrain greenhouse effects.\n\nShortly after I arrived at the campground there was a rocky sounding slide due North of the campground.  It was one of the Crowsfoot Couloirs dumping mostly rock.  No-mans-land, but interesting because there is so little snow on the southerly facing aspects.",

        "Comments 1": "While it was a small avalanche that was I caught in and it did not even move me downhill, I'd like to identify the mistakes clearly made which caused this result. Partner bailed but still went out today with the intent of exploring around Catherine's Pass just to take a look and take one ride out using the low angle terrain near the trail to the pass to get back down to the meadow. Started at 12:30 and got to the pass at 3:00. Since it stopped snowing and began to clear, decided to skin up to the ridgeline for a better view.  Dug 3 pits, one prior in the meadow just for curiosity’s sake, another along the ridge and another towards what I believed to be the top of the run ‘so long’.  After these assessments, it was apparent riding any of these open slopes could be a bad play. By the time I was at what I perceived to be ‘so long’ it was snowing pretty well again and the fatigue that had set in had begun to cloud my judgment. Instead of taking the time to simply use my own skin track back to the meadow, figured I could save time and energy by riding or just hiking down the spine. (Looker’s right of 'so long' utilizing all the trees as anchors.) \n\nAs I started down, I didn’t locate the specific trees I had seen several times before and then realized I was not near so long but actually on sunset, which starts out at even lower angle but has a short, steep section for what I believe was about 20-30 yards to get to the meadow. Attempted 3 turns to release any sluff which it did and released a good bit of snow to my right. So had let that pass and attempted to change direction to exit to my left by crossing the slope and once I did, it released about 5 or so yards above me and was easily able to stop and let the snow pass without issue. \n\nTook only one photo which is attached and surprised how far it had continued to my left. Again, a bad estimate on distance but would guess 60-80 yards? Rode down to the meadow and out but think about the following mistakes. (1) Should have never been on that north facing slope, especially being well aware of the advisory and previous snow still in place, (2) solo, (3) deviated from original plan, (4) used fatigue and time constraints as an excuse to not backtrack safely, (5) knowingly going into a short, but potential terrain trap, (6) changing direction after releasing the sluff. \n\nThought it was important to report and get the appropriate feedback. \n\nForecaster Comments:  Excellent perspective on the event.  Thank you for submitting the observation.  Should inspire others heading out over the weekend that avalanche season has begun.",

        "Comments 1": "No big surprise here, given last night's excellent storm and the previous ground cover conditions. I observed this slide at about 1:30 PM while walking the ridge east from the top of Flagstaff, and it appeared to have been triggered remotely by the only other skier to traverse the ridge before me. The skier's broken trail was not connected to any portion of the crown, but the crown and bed surface looked pretty fresh, with just a touch of wind deposited graupel on top. The crown of the slide is at least 10 feet below the ridge on the north side, and in many places it is more than 50 feet down the north side. The slide extends from Oingo Boingo on the east several hundred feet over toward Two Dogs, although I do not believe it took out Two Dogs or the adjacent terrain east of Two Dogs. I did not get close enough to the crown to check it out, but it appears as though the slide took out the entire snowpack in this area. Bad visibility and no access to a good vantage point, so no photos. I suppose this slide could have been natural but given how fresh it looked I assume it was triggered by the other skier, perhaps unknowingly...",
        "Comments 2": "I enjoyed a few runs on south facing LCC beginning around 11 AM and found the storm snow to be mostly held in place by the shape of the summer surface. I found decomposing melt-freeze crust underneath the storm snow at all elevations in these locations, and I did not find the new snow to exhibit siginificant fracturing properties in these locations--generally right side up and very, um, powdery. It didn't look like anybody ventured into West Bowl of Silver or Days today. I did not notice any obvious collapsing today, although I did my darn'dest to stay on S facing (having learned a lesson last winter).

I did not see any skiers or tracks in the area, and the starting zone is overhung by steep rocky features, making it subject to enhanced wind-loading and an obvious place to harbor weak snow.

The most notable was a very large, full-path slide in the Z Gully on the N side of Cherry Peak. \n\nThe debris pile was massive ( the pictures don't do it justice). \n\nWe observed numerous wet loose avalanches on all aspects in the drainage as well as evidence of larger slides from earlier in the season. Deposition fields were very widespread with broken trees and debris scattered over the\n\nentire basin. \n\n \n\nNote: The ski out took work. The high snow levels made it impossible to find the summer trail and the warm snow was extra sticky, Navigation was unfun. We were lucky that the creek wasn't running higher because we had to cross (skis off) multiple times over sketchy snow bridges. All of the side creeks are running as well. We basically walked out about 7-8 miles. If you are thinking about heading out this way, I'd say don't. The water levels are only going to rise and make the creek crossings VERY dangerous if not impossible. Hiking back up to Naomi/TG is the safest option. \n",

Pulled out a few small, manageable winds slabs as I descended, then encountered a much more substantial variety set off by the party ahead of me. The clue here was the solitary track ON the debris, three sets of erased tracks, and no other tracks in Stairs. Hopefully someone from this group can shed more light on the experience, though I snapped a fast pic (so fast the shutter apparently didn't open entirely..) which pretty well sums it up. Debris ran over a near vertical pitch of blue ice, and some hundred plus feet beyond. There is a substantial debris pile beneath the pinch that the eagle eyed may notice; however, most of that is from a large release off the east facing upper wall days prior.\n\nThere has also been substantial recent shedding in Stairs, the other photo displays some of this.",

        "Comments 1": "We came upon this slide on Sunday 1/10, but it was obvious that it was at least a day or two old, if not older. It was a prime example of the avalanche problem of this season - a slab failing on the old faceted snow. The avalanche broke from just off the ridge and ran until the bench below the upper gladed headwall. The slide exposed the rocks and earth below the bed surface. It took out trees that appeared to be 12 inches in diameter. While this wasn't a huge slide, it would certainly have been a very painful if not deadly ride. There were maybe four sets of tracks altogether in E. Mineral, and it looked like some might have skied down the slide path. Perhaps they triggered it from the ridge? \n\n \n\nWe observed this slide first from the ridge between Georges and Mid Ivory during our approach. These steep trees were our area of concern of the day and seeing the avalanche reinforced the point that steep shady terrain is off limits. We proceeded down our run with caution and gave steep roll overs a wide berth. There were no other noted signs of instability, besides a poor snow structure observed via pole pen. \n",

She went first, made two turns, looked like it would just slough but then saw the slope fracture above her. It didn't have a lot of energy and as she stopped it easily went past her and the tree she was up against without any issue. Still, we were a little surprised at how sensitive it was and how cleanly it slid. We had not noticed any cracking while skinning up, although there had been recent activity higher above our location I the very steep terrain.

        "Comments 1": "I reported these results as they were not the norm this morning for our teams. The explosive triggered slide mentioned above is a N-NW  aspect off Millicent Peak above Twin Lake. This area recieives alot of wind and did not hold snow until mid Jan. The shot landed in thin rocky area and propagated deeper from there. This was the only event into old snow for our teams today. Today was the first time in a while that control results were negative and/or isolated to new snow.\nHowever by noon we had receive report of a unintentional user triggered slide off Pioneer Ridge above Dog Lake. Reported as 12-36 \" deep 400 wide. We have not seen natural activity in this area since before this weeks storm. This area has seen substaintial traffic this week. As I write this I am receiving report of yet another human triggered slide West of the first off Pioneer Ridge 3' deep 20' wide pushing user into trees. Perhaps the weight of a human is tipping the scales.\nJust a note-  Aspect and elevation of these 3 slopes is almost identical\nForecaster note (Bruce Tremper):\nI was returning from looking at the Tuscaroroa slide when I heard about the Pioneer slide and I went to the toe of the debris to look at it.  While I was digging in the snow, a lone skier descended from above and said that he triggered an avalanche to the west of the avalanche I was looking at.  He said it was 3' deep and 20' wide and it pushed him into a tree but he was OK.  Very lucky!",

We knew what we were getting into but did not expect the slabs to be so cohesive and strong.  Collapse was entire slab at once with very loud boom....my son stated that it sounded like an avalanche control hand charge.  Tried to outrun it but the slab stayed together and gained speed rapidly so ended up stuck on top of it.  These will be a bit more hidden under the new lighter snow tomorrow.  ",

The slide mover very slow and was quite small but still had enough mass to prevent him from self arresting or getting up to ski out of it. The rest of out party transitioned into skis, and ski cutting released even more.\n\nThis was a small slide over low consequence terrain.

        "Comments 4": "We saw 2 avalanches in Silver Fork today. One came out of the top of a steep north facing chute just west of East Bowl Pass. This was a natural that released sometime around noon on the 24th, between our first and second runs in the area. The picture shows a well defined crown in a wind loaded portion at the top of the chute. We did not go examine the crown, but it was likely around 6-12\", the slide was shallow and new snow only. It ran approximately 400 vertical feet. The second avalanche occurred sometime on the 23rd, based on a little new snow on top of the debris, in the East Bowl of Silver Fork. The photo shows the debris pile. There were some old tracks from the previous day still visible along the side of the avalanche. Its hard to know whether there were other tracks that were covered by the slide, or not, and we could not determine where the top of the slide was located, but it seems to have originated up in the rocks at the top of the bowl.",

After an extended dry spell, 12\"-20\" of snow accompanied by mod-strong SW winds placed a significant load on a shallow and fragile snowpack. Did not get close enough to observe the crown but snowpits dug that day, and up to this point throughout the season, revealed a stratified and faceted snowpack, with the primary layer of concern being a weak layer of loose facets from early November storms sitting on top of a faceted, knife hard, melt-freeze layer formed in late October. We also observed a weak layer higher up in the snowpack that failed with a score of ECTP18, and this could also be the culprit, but due to widespread sensitivity and collapsing on the deeper, faceted layer above the crust at 35 cm, I'm inclined to believe that is the weak layer involved here. \n\n\n",

Our party was moving north from West Bowl in Silver Fork towards Upper Meadow Chutes. A solo skier passed us, we all grouped up above Doug's Drop. The solo skier (name unknown) geared up and took off without telling us where he planned to ski. After we talked as a group, we made our way north again and before dropping into Meadow Chutes, we noticed the solo skier's tracks going northwest into Day's Fork. I looked over the ridge and onto the slope, to find it had ripped to the ground and there was heavy debris piled into trees, with no clear ski tracks exiting the slide area. I began screaming downhill and heard the solo skiers voice say he was OK and not to ski down above him. Scary as hell, could have been a very different story. Heavily treed, northwest slope into Day's Fork between Doug's Drop and Upper Meadow Chutes.",

        "Comments 1": "This avalanche was triggered by an intentional slope cut from the Snowbird patrol on route in the last 48 hours. The initial release was a small wind slab at the ridge, and when it traveled down slope it released this larger pocket, failing on a graupel layer. This type of avalanche was ubiquitous around the range on many aspects above 8500'. There was evidence of another similar slide up higher in the drainage just below the headwall on the east facing slopes of the East Twin in Mary Ellen Gulch. This slide was remote triggered over 300m away due to mitigation work in the neighboring drainage of Mineral Basin (48 hours prior). There was also buried debris all throughout the drainage. The natural cycle, and ensuing AE and AS triggered avalanches during and following the week's storm is impressive. A truly widespread problem in the technical sense of the word.\n\nPhotos:\n\n1. Sinners SE Profile and Avalanche SS-ASc-R2D1.5-I\n\n2. Same slide different angle.\n\n3. Upper Mary Ellen Gulch SS-ABr-R3D1.5-I. There is also buried debris visible in the upper Silver Creek bowl and the Outhouse Chutes.\n\n4. Y Not Butress SS-AE-R2-D2-I. Released smaller pocket low on slope below convex roll. (Started from top of buttress. There are shot holes visible adjacent to avalanche path- assume explosive triggered from Heli work). Old Buried debris also visible in runout of Outhouse Chutes right side of frame.\n\n \n\nNumerous other guided parties were out and about skiing similar aspects and elevations with no activity noted during the day today. \n",

        "Comments 1": "My partner and I found ourselves climbing Reynolds peak via its northern ridge (from Dog Lake). The avalanche ripped from a northeastern pocket on the ridge line immediately north of an aspen glade which ran from the ridge to the bottom of the apron. When we investigated, we began to appreciate the slide's severity. Reaching a depth of ~4ft in locations and stretching for ~300 ft, it was immense. We noted that the avalanche failed on the PWL and propagated for at least a third of Reynolds' east face. After wrapping around towards the south and then back towards dog lake, we observed that the avalanche debris cascaded until ~8900 ft, removing a few small trees and branches. On the ridge, there was a western/southwestern wind which contributed to small cornices around the east face. However, my partner and I struggled to produce any collapses. We found no evidence of skiers or animals, thus it is likely that the avalanche was caused by the heavy snowfall/naturally, which was our first assumption. The visibility was rather poor today, and my phone camera was similar to if I had dropped it in a bucket of water, so apologies in advance if the pictures are unhelpful. For those of you touring in Mill D, this slide should be visible for those that hike beyond the reaches of Tom's Hill. Best of luck this weekend. \n",

Pits in the general vicinity indicated that a Rime Crust was formed sometime around Tuesday/Wednesday and this is now buried 10 inches down. Very Easy to Easy, Q1, SP Shears were observed directly below this Rime Crust. The slide appeared to initiate on .5mm facets below this Rime Crust. Another Easy to Moderate Q1, SP Shear was also noted 15 inches below the Rime Crust Shear. After the initial failure below the Rime Crust there appeared to be a step down in the other previously cited weak layer. Then as it descended down hill it rolled over a steep Convex feature that was a rock slab with slope angles > 45 degrees. At this point the slide stepped down for the second time and caused the failure into Basal Facets. This part of the slide appeared to be 6 to 8 feet deep. The entire slide propagated at least 300 feet wide with the deep failure confined to the steep Chutes directly below the Peak. The initial slide started approximately 125 feet below the Peak. Size of the slide appeared to be D 2.5.\n\nPicture not the greatest due to the limited visibility. \n\nSustained Moderate to Strong Winds out of the WNW began blowing around 1045 and Transport was Intense.

At least some of them are very familiar with the area. 4 were partially buried. 2 were able to ride away from the avalanche.\n\n \n\nHere's their story as told on IG account-\n\n\"Today we were riding in the uintas, the snow was great up high and it was finally feeling like we had some base. I have been riding sleds in this particular area since I was 8 years old. I am very familiar with the area. My brother and I were playing on the side of a hill in the a tree area where have have ridden 30-40 times in years past.. (Right side of the video). We had 3 other friends and one younger below in the flats. As I finished recording my brother playing in the pow, the mountain shook. My original thought was... earthquake. Than it it me, avalanche. As I turned and looked up I could see the snow wave coming. My brothers back was turned and I screamed avalanche as loud as I could. Now here comes my mistake #1. I pulled my klim avalanche backpack and boom, nothing happened. I hadn’t turned it on. A second later the snow hit and the swimming started. Somehow I only moved about 20 yards and stayed on top of the snow (MIRACLE) . Only being buried to my lower chest I dug myself out. My little brothers sled was running and I could hear the yelling on the radio. I could hear someone in the trees, but I couldn’t figure out where. I ran to my brothers sled and turned it off. I now could hear him screaming my name. Mistake #2 had I not been able to hear his voice I would of been lost. My beacon, probe, and shovel were all in my backpack but I would of had no clue what to do first. Let me tell you There is no worse feeling than having your little brother buried. I followed his voice and saw the top of his black helmet and his voice and started digging. About 60 seconds later I had his face uncovered. He was okay. Than came the radio chatter, where is everyone at? Was everyone okay? We didn’t realize it but the avalanche had also triggered even bigger on the other side of trees where we were. My youngest brother was able to out run it so was one of our other friends. Our 2 other friends both got hit with the wave on the FLATS. Craig and his sled were both buried. Craig got his shoot off in time, which ultimately probably saved his life. The person filming (Nate) was buried to about his face and somehow was able\"",

        "Comments 1": "Was making my way up the ridge where wind loading was evident and still occurring with transport of the surface snow. Cornice formation was beginning, but were still wind walls, not yet overhanging. Surface wind slab formation was also occurring, generally 5-10cm deep, 4F, and not super touchy. I did find the occasional more reactive 1F patch of snow.\n\n \n\nI was winding my way up the ridge, regularly changing directions to manage slope angle, cornice formation, firmer snow, and blustery wind. I stopped in a flat-ish spot just uphill of a tree to change directions and move left around the windward side of the cornice. \n\n \n\nI stomped a bit to pack the snow in and enable me to turn when the avalanche released. The fracture sheared nearly vertically and dropped the bulk of the cornice (which was not overhung). It also propagated along the ridgeline about 75 feet. Below the cornice was a flat moment in the snow, which retained the pictured hang fire. The convex roll just below this fractured and released a slab about 30ft across by 20ft of vert that ran downslope at least 50ft into the trees.\n\n \n\nThe cornice was a couple feet tall and 1F. The slab was about 10cm deep and on the hard side of 4F. Failure was on the interface with the old snow; noted no facets.\n",

One thing is very clear... this is truly a tragic avalanche accident-\n\nA family is out for a day of snowmobiling and they take a break for lunch in a wide open basin on the West Fork of the Duchesne. Four young family members walk to the edge of what appears to be a packed trail, however the edge is a cornice. They collapse the slope and two boys ages 7 and 14 are caught, carried, and subsequently buried at the bottom of the slope.\n\nWhile the father looks for the two boys, the mother jumps on her snowmobile and heads towards the trailhead to find help. She runs into State Parks grooming personnel who then activates 911. Wasatch and Summit County S&R along with two medical helicopters are dispatched. The small avalanche path is difficult to locate, but when the medical helicopters land, they discover the father performing CPR on both of his sons.\n\nThe two boys are flown from the scene and pass away later in the evening at the hospital.\n\nMany thanks to all the heroic efforts put forth by Wasatch and Summit County Search and Rescue along with State Parks and Air Med personnel.",

The danger was rated as Moderate for Wednesday Jan 16th and changing weather was not a factor in this accident.\n\nFrom the Jan. 16th advisory-\n\n\"Northerly winds have been brutal along the high ridges and they're having no problem whipping all the fresh new snow into stiff wind drifts. Today you'll find these chalky looking, hollow sounding slabs along the leeward side of mid and upper elevation ridges. They're most prevalent on slopes facing the south half of the compass, but I suspect you'll find a fresh drift or two cross-loaded in upper elevation chutes and gullies as well. In either case, todays slabs will break a bit wider and deeper than you might expect.\"\n",

Cold temperatures, high elevation terrain, and shallow snow depths are the norm for the range. We often see deep instabilities linger late in the season. The early portion of the winter started with a promising storm track and relatively warm temperatures. While the region experienced a large natural and remotely triggered avalanche cycle the week of Dec. 17th, in general avalanche activity has remained unusually predictable and the snowpack has been relatively strong. Very cold temperatures filtered into the region on January 11th, lasting to the 15th. Overnight lows reaching to -25 degrees were common in low laying basins with terrain features similar to the West Fork of the Duchesne. During this time about a foot of very light density snow fell. Jan. 14-17 brought very strong Northeast winds to the region. Averaging 30-40 mph with gusts into the 60's and 70's, winds channeled through this basin, forming very dense slabs in unusual locations.",

He new it would probably crack out seeing that there was a fairly distinct wind slab sitting on top of the steepest line in the bowl, and we new there was faceted snow under it because there is always facets in this N facing protected location. There were two choices, ski cut it and let it run and mess up the line or ski it fast and outrun it. The amount of new snow was not enough to pose much harm except maybe knock you down, and the run out was clean so he went for the outrun choice, which worked out fine seeing that the slide did not move very fast. The wind slab released on facets that were formed before the storm, then stepped down to the underlying crust, but petered out about 300 vertical feet down the slope when angle eased up.\n\nphotos: crown, facets beneath the wind slab, and the run out\n",

When we changed our minds, we decided to cross the gulch at Chad's gap.  When we came to a steeper section on the way into the gulch, we decided to cross it one at a time.  While about 40ft ahead of my partner I was fooled into a false sense of security by my perceived brevity of a steep slope, and decided to continue.  Three steps into the slope the entire face broke about five feet above me.  It was a foolish decision not to turn back and continue up the cat track and around upon first sight of this slope.  Don't make the same mistake I did under the impression that it will save you time, and don't allow yourself to downplay the risks as I did: I was lucky cut to my left and stay on top of this slide.  \n\nIt is difficult to say whether the slide breaking to the facets was because of a step down from sloughing or caused entirely by my full weight being added to the snowpack.  \n\nBecause the area just above the slide still seemed liable to slide we did not get close enough to the crown for precise depth measurements, I quickly got out of the way and snapped the photos shown below, then called the slide in.

I didn't have the best view when they kicked it off, but it looked like they booted up the rocky area, put skis back on once they got above it, and then the first person up triggered this on a kick turn in a wind loaded area. It propagated maybe 50 feet across and had a crown that looked to be 12\" or so at the deepest area. (The party that triggered this continued up to the ridge without incident. The party pictured here isn't the one that triggered this, it was a group headed up after them.)\n\nWas on a timeframe so I didn't have a chance to go poke around and see what the culprit layer was, but I'd suspect facets were involved. This little zone off the ridge constantly gets stripped by the wind and always seem to harbor a thin, rotten snowpack. This isn't the most consequential terrain and getting caught in this little guy probably wouldn't have ruined your day, but in the more extreme terrain people are undoubtedly getting into today it sure could have. Low danger doesn't mean no danger... \nForecaster: also thinking this could be a lingering wind slab....\n\n\n",

        "Comments 1": "Saw this slide from my bedroom window Sunday morning.   Slide wasn't there Saturday and I suspect the strong winds Saturday night loaded enough snow to cause the weak snow to collapse.  This is a low elevation slope with shallow snow pack.   I wasn't able to make it up to poke around so observations are from a Saturday afternoon snowshoe outing I went on with my wife. I wasn't on this slope but other slopes in the area had weak, faceted snow all the way to the ground. There was a layer about 6\" down and I would guess that the south most section of the slide appears to have broken on and not stepped down. The north section of the slide broke further down.     This slide seems to have matched your 2/8 warning re shallow snow and low elevations almost perfectly.",

I didn't stick around to make a more detailed observation (I apologize). The propagation occurred on a convex roll over down the ridge from the summit where much smaller cornices had built up. It didn't carry much speed, but I was surprised of the overall size of the pocket that moved. - Probably a pretty common occurrence yesterday for the salt lake area wind effected terrain.

        "Comments 1": "I'm not sure if this is to be classified as an \"avalanche,\" but after descending the Hypodermic Needle in foggy conditions, I skied too close to the base of the rocks skier's right of the couloir. The entire snowpack collapsed, giving way to a massive rock-well. I luckily landed on the edge of the snow and all my gear remained on top as well. Had I fallen into the bottom, this could have easily been catastrophic. Given the foggy conditions, it is unlikely that my partner would have seen me go in. After ten years in the backcountry, this is the first time something like this has happened to me. It serves as a reminder to give cliffbands and trees a wide berth and to travel with caution in areas with glide cracks. \n\n \n\nPhoto attached of the opening. Prior to me skiing across, the entire well was covered in a snowbridge. I landed prone on the edge, bottom of the photo.\n\n \n",

All the above observations were guesses, we did not investigate further as there were no tracks going into the path. \nWhat initially caught my eye was the solo track to lookers left of the slide along the tree line in the second photo. The track did not really show in the photo, but was same aspect and elevation and maybe 100 yards from the slide. Solo traveler in what is now prime terrain for a slide, in a fairly remote area. \nYipes. \nIn addition we also noticed a wet natural from a point release that entrained a pretty large amount of snow in the same drainage, same elevation, opposing aspect. We also noted a crazy variety of conditions on the east/west running ridge line we traveled on. Everything from localized whomphing, to  fully supportable sun crusts that were still dry underneath, to unsupportable facet pits, changing with each step. Hand pits showed the same tremendous amount of variety in small areas on similar aspects all of which made us pretty uncomfortable with the idea of skiing pretty much anything even a little steep. \nLow angle, north facing trees were nice skiing, though. \n \n",

        "Comments 1": "\nParty of 3 climbed to Cardiff Pass then west toward Superior. Experienced moderate wind and a few stronger gusts - consistent with the last few days' forecasts. Stopped to transition just short of Little Superior intending to ride the higher ground on SE aspect. First rider began to traverse right to reach that point and triggered the slab within seconds. Party member above reports feeling a collapse underfoot - it's possible the trigger was from above. Rider attempted to move right and didn't make much progress before falling into seated position and \"swimming\" to stay on top. Rider was carried about 60 feet before coming to a stop without burial. The slide ran at least 800? vertical feet down the gully towards Two Trees - didn't get a great look at the full path on the exit. Party continued right and descended ridges.\n\n \nIn hindsight:\n\n- We did not respect the forecast in our terrain choice. The group was familiar with recent forecasts and discussed impact of the wind multiple times but opted to continue with original objective after *very* casual observations along the skin track didn't expose activity.\n\n- A few tens of yards of climbing could have made the difference in terrain. Because we stopped short it was necessary to make a small traverse to the safer high ground, but doing so meant crossing above an obvious trap. Transitioning a bit further ahead would have kept us out of the gully and on safer terrain from the start.\n\n- The transition had thin cover in places and exposed rocks. Could have noted the weak point and taken it into account.\n\n \n\nClose call and humbling for sure.\n\n\n",

Approximately 50 feet from the chute entrance the snow started to slide and I could see spider web and the fracture line above me spreading toward Sushi Chute. The fracture line was several hundred feet wide (and wider than \"typical\" slides in that chute). I was carried several hundred feet and able to get myself out of the deposition zone. Was skiing solo. I had skied the area yesterday and the snow was wet and there appeared to be good bonding with the underlying snow pack. I had climbed up Mt. Millicent for access and there was an approximately 20 mph wind from the west and heavy slab deposits on the east fact of Milly. I watched a group test and ski cut the East Face and of Milly and release some large runs and decided against skiing that aspect. I anticipated that west facing and more protected aspects of Stupid Chute would be a safer route. I complete several ski cuts at the entrance (not much powder, solid pack) and approximately 30 feet into stupid chute (decent bonding with new snow, no noticeable wind slab). I then made 4-5 turns and the slide released.\n",

        "Comments 1": "At approximately 900 hours, almost the entire amount of the Rocky Points area avalanched naturally. This occurred during a period of high PI and wind loading with mostly Light Category winds. The Soft Slab was predominantly 4 finger in hardness. Debris piles from the Main Rocky Points Chute was the deepest at approximately one meter deep. The initial weak layer was one to two inches above the old snow/new snow interface, and then it appeared to step down to the old snow/melt freeze crust. The weak layer was a light density layer in the new snow, directly above the interface. There was some bonding to the old snow, and this appeared to be a result of the warmth in the old snow surface. Interestingly, there were facets on top of the old snow surface on the highest starting zones in the NNE facing Rocky Points Main chutes. These facets were up to 1mm and were showing signs of rounding. Also, the old snow surface crust in this area was 1 to 2 inches deep and there were moderate sized facets below this crust; and this weakness was just one of three layers that were cracking.  Widespread cracking and collapsing was occurring on all slopes with angles > 30 degrees. Slopes between 30 and 35 degrees were cracking and not moving. All slopes with angles > 35 degrees were either already cleaned out or cracking, and very sensitive and easy to initiate activity. The cracking layers were 4 to 8 inches down, as well as at the old snow surface. Propagation was pronounced and rapid. \nAnother avalanche of note was the Wet Slab observed in the lower half of the Main Dog Lake Chute. See photo. This appeared to be human triggered and produced when the snow surface was very wet/damp. The debris pile here was > one meter deep. It appeared that the trigger escaped off the slab to rider's right. This slide was 55 feet wide, 4 to 6 inches deep, and ran only 100 feet to the flats. \n",

        "Comments 4": "This avalanche occurred during a stormy period that brought a round of very dense, wet snow with the rain/snow line near 9000'. A period of strong SW winds accompanied the event, and several natural storm/wind slab avalanches occurred on upper elevation, northerly aspects. No rain fell in areas that are generally considered avalanche terrain in the range, at least not where recreation occurs, or where there is generally sufficient snow. No other wet avalanche activity was observed. \n\n\n\nUpon arrival at the toe of the avalanche, I was confronted with what certainly appeared to be wet avalanche debris. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe starting zone was several hundred feet above the rain/snow line, and the crown was located just below the ridge crest on a slope leeward to the wind. \n\n \n\nThe crown face presented as a dry snow, storm slab with deep wind drifting on the observers right hand side. This is concurrent with other avalanches that occurred during this period. \n\n\n\nIt's my conclusion that the avalanche failed as a storm or wind slab, triggered by loading from very dense snow and strong winds a few hundred feet above the rain snow line. It did not appear to be triggered by saturation, but it certainly entrained saturated snow as it moved down in elevation giving the debris the appearance of a wet avalanche. ",

        "Comments 1": "Traveled Bowman/Yellow Jacket out Alexander Basin today to see what natural activity occurred with Thursday/Friday snow.  I couldn't see prominent crowns from afar in the Porter Fork/Gobbler's NW area but walking any ridgelines that had seen last weekend's wind produced collapses and shooting cracks with almost every step (Pic 6).  While many slopes under ~35 degrees had collapsed and stayed in place along the Yellow Jacket ridge, Alexander was a different story.  At least two of the chutes of Depth Hoar Bowl naturaled and once debris reached more continuous terrain below the midslope rock bands, the slab propagated across the majority of the bowl's NE aspect. \n\nPic 1 shows a slab that initiated closer to the ridge ~35' wide and the propagation under the tree and rock bands underneath (Pic 3).  Pic 2 is similar more Northerly facing in the bowl.  Crowns were generally 14-20\" failing on extremely weak November facets.\n\nI triggered one more chute from the ridge, wind-affected snow collapsing and propagating to the crown ~50' downslope.\n\n \n\nInterestingly, the East Bowl didn't have any debris or crowns visible from the ridge, possibly due to more complex terrain and rock features breaking up the facet layer.  The uppermost basin of Alexander had a few smaller crowns visible midslope or lower.  \n\n \n\nToday's warm temps turned the south half of the compass moist and some wet-loose activity was present on steep SE-W slopes as well as lower slopes of all aspects.  \n\n \n",

        "Comments 1": "At around 16:30 I entered the gully just east and parallel to the Red Pine Lake summer trail and skin track used to access Lake Shot. Noted both hard wind crust and soft snow. This is not a particularly steep area, maybe 30 degrees where I transitioned so was somewhat surprise to have the slope fracture on my second turn and sweep me off balance. Fortunately, the avalanche was not deep but I did go for an unwanted ride. Managed to lose a pole as I kept a handle on my airbag trigger but did not have to deploy. As has been noted by others the crust is not well bonded to underlying snow and is reason for concern.\n\n \n\nThe spot where I entered the chute was approximately 15 feet in width and my transition here could possible have created weakness in the snowpack. As I initiated my second turn on some firm wind crust the slope fractured and swept me off my feet. I was carried for 350 feet and total length of avalanche was 550 ft with a maximum width of 70 feet. Fortunately, the depth was not great and I was able to maintain a feet first position and avoid being consumed by debris nor did I have to deploy my airbag. It was difficult to determine the initial fracturing layer depth at the crown but some of the blocks towards the toe were in excess of 12\". This is heavily wind impacted area with rock outcroppings that could have been a contributing factor.\n\n \n\nCrown location 40.53527, -111.69549 elev. 10600, Toe 40.53597, -111.69372\n",

        "Comments 1": "Skiing down off the backside of Mt. Raymond, and decided to drop a steeper part of Paradise than I've done before. The top was a bit wind loaded and we assumed it might break. My companion started down and, sure enough, maybe four turns into it I heard a \"woomph\" and saw the entire top break away. I yelled down to him and he easily skied out to the left while a river of snow swept down, pulling out all the snow down to the dirt and staying within the space between the trees that stood on either side.  Clearly broke on the Thanksgiving layer. (Would have carried but not buried him, given the profile of the terrain and how much open space there was.)\n \n\nWe knew going into it that a slide was possible to likely (to certain), given that it ticked all the boxes (maybe 36°, NE-facing), and planned accordingly. \n \n\nI skied down the ridge 50 feet to a less steep part and descended without incident. \n\n \n\nMy sense is that we should expect anything over 35° (at least) and N/E-facing will slide. Not assume that it *might* but rather assume that it *will*. This was an area that I knew pretty well, but that same slope profile on something like Gobblers (more open and few exit routes), or Holy Toledo (narrow and nowhere to go when it breaks) would be hard to mitigate the risk. I worry that people assume that if something has been skied it's therefore safe. It could simply be that the person skiing it a) has a different risk profile, b) knows the area and how to manage/avoid risk (Mark White and the Monitors/No Name Bowl comes to mind), or c) was ignorant and (fortunately) lucky. I've definitely fallen into that \"c\" category. \n",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "Eleven snowboarders rented a private snowcat with the intent of riding in backcountry terrain. After a morning of riding a few laps without any signs of instability, the group decided to push it a little higher in elevation and further to the south. When they got to their new location, they began to assess the slope. The group was divided in their feelings about the slope, particularly because it was a little steeper. With this in mind, they positioned a few riders in safe locations in case of an avalanche. \n\nOne rider (it is unknown whether he was the first on the slope or not) decided to jump off a small cliff at the top of the hill. Upon landing, he triggered the avalanche, catching him and one other rider from the group. One of the riders suffered tibia and fibula fractures from hitting trees on the way down the slope, while the other rider was fully buried. Unfortunately, the rider who was fully buried had turned his beacon off earlier in the day because of low batteries. After the dust cleared, the other group members quickly realized that one person was buried. They desperately searched the avalanche debris, and were unable to find a transceiver signal. Eventually, they saw a board sticking out of the snow; the buried rider had decided to pow-surf the run, rather than snowboard. The group was able to use his leash to find him beneath the snow and dig him out quickly. The buried rider didn’t suffer any injuries.\n\nThe crew helped the injured rider down the mountain and into the snowcat, which immediately took off towards the trailhead. Around 5:00 pm, the snowcat was approximately 2.3 miles from the trailhead when it suddenly broke down. They had no cellphone service and could not get the snowcat working properly, so two members of the group ran 2.3 miles back to the Smith Moorehouse trailhead, got in their trucks, and drove to Kamas where they notified Search & Rescue. A medical helicopter was then dispatched and the injured rider was airlifted to the hospital. ",

        "Comments 1": "\nWe remotely triggered a D2 slide today in Martha’s Bowl underneath Pioneer Peak around 10:45 am. No one was caught or carried, but it gave us a good scare. We were headed towards Rocky Point from Brighton, following a skintrack through the rolling terrain in the Lake Mary area. I was in the lead, and our team naturally spaced out as we crossed underneath Martha’s Bowl. At the end of the traverse underneath the rocky cliffs, I skied down about a 10’ depression on the previously set skin track. None of us heard or felt a collapse or whoomp, but I thought maybe I heard a plane above. I looked up to my left to the cliffs and saw a large avalanche starting. The crown broke all the way across the bowl to a West facing aspect. We estimate the crown was about 300’ or so wide and 18”-3’ deep, possibly up to 4’ deep on the wind-loaded side of the crown.\n\nAlthough a large amount of snow was coming down, it wasn’t moving that fast. Upon seeing the release, I was able to move out of the slide path area and up onto a small raised terrain feature. Adam yelled “avalanche” and Caroline tried to get to a higher/safer area, but quickly realized that if the slide had more energy or more snow, we would have all been in real trouble. The slide stopped about 40’ from the skin track I had been on. It covered up 75’ of the skin track we had already come across, and in certain places, the skin track was covered by 4-5’ of debris because of a small terrain trap area. The slide had enough power to take out two small pine trees. \n\nFrom the start, our plan was to ski moderate terrain under 30 degrees. In retrospect, we should have stayed lower and further away from the steep slope once we got to Lake Mary and beyond. This was a serious reminder to pay attention to hangfire above and connected to lower angled slopes, and to take our team route planning and communication more seriously. We were also reminded not to blindly follow a previously set skin track. Today’s avalanche forecast read “I suspect our luck will run out soon.” I’m glad we weren’t on the other side of luck today. \n\n",

        "Comments 1": "While traversing across the base Wolverine Cirque below the scythe towards granny chute I heard a far distant \"whump\" that actually sounded like a muffled charge going off... Without the echo.  I couldn't tell where it was coming from, and within a minute of hearing that noise I saw a slide start approximately 30 feet above me.  It was 10:30 A.M. It was a hard slab that broke free about 30 feet across and slid down past me putting me square in the middle of the moving snow.  I was actually able to plant myself in place and maintain my position as the hard slab broke around me.  It was deeper on the skiers left side of the slide due to wind loading.  At it's deepest it was about 8 inches (South side)... At the shallowest about 4 inches (North side).  The snow continued past me another 30 to 40 feet and then came to a stop without much trouble.\n",

It took the snow right down to dirt level,\" authorities said.\nDale Christensen, 40, was flown by helicopter to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo, where he was pronounced dead.\n \n\nThe avalanche happened near the Co-op Creek area in Summit County, about 10 miles east of Heber City, near Strawberry Reservoir.\nRon Hazard, of the Wasatch County Sheriff's Office, said, \"The slide was about 200 feet wide and 1,000 feet long, and it took the snow down to dirt and rocks.\"\nThe massive slide hit three snowmobilers who were fixing one of the men's machines Monday afternoon. Two swam out; the third was buried for about 45 minutes.\n\"We started CPR immediately, and LifeFlight came in and transported the victim with CPR in progress,\" Hazard said.\nChristensen wasn't wearing an avalanche beacon.\n\"I don't know what else to say. It's dangerous out there, and the snow needs to be respected,\" Hazard said.\nThis is the third avalanche to bury people in just over a week. The first, on Dec. 23, has been described as a freak occurrence, taking place in-bounds at The Canyons resort.\nTwo people were swept away: 30-year-old Jesse Williams hit a tree and died. An 11-year-old boy survived. The area had just recently been opened. The resort said there were no indications it was unstable.\nMike Goar, of The Canyons, said at the time, \"Conditions can change sometimes by the minute, and we felt good about it again, the fact it was open for skiing yesterday, the stability of that general area, and it was OK to be opened.\"\nThen on Christmas, a second slide and a second death. This time 53-year-old Dave Balls was snowmobiling with his family when a wall of snow buried him near Thousand Peaks Recreation Park.\nSummit County Sheriff Dave Edmunds said, \"I actually know the individual very well and know the family. It's very difficult for me personally, [to be] the bearer of such bad tidings.\"\nAvalanche danger in the Western Uintahs is just below extreme right now. The Wastach Mountains are almost as dangerous.\nJust one more reminder to be prepared and know the conditions before you head out.",

Watched that same area as well as the rest of Timp and Cascade Peak through the end of day Feb 2nd. Noted a couple other much smaller wet slides on timpanogos in the southwest aspect, but nothing else otherwise on either peak from this specific observation point.\n\n \n\nNot surprised to have seen these slides either, given how much snow we've had so far this season and the lack of direct warmth till the last couple days. On the contrary seemed like we were overdue for them in comparison to my observations in other years. Wet slides are upon us in steep sunlit terrain, so be plenty cautious of that. \n\n \n\nFirst image is at 2:00 p.m. on February 2nd and the second image is at 5:30 p.m. on February 2nd for comparison. \n",

Im not sure of the exact location name, but the shot is the next obvious draw skiers right from the eastern rock buttress. A small hop was all it took to get the slab to release. Crown was roughly 75 feet in length, slab depth was about 6-8 inches judging by the crown. The slide continued over a convexity, but did not appear to step down into any weak layers besides the storm snow. Assuming the slab debris initiated sloughing in the snow down slope. Debris reached the normal transition spot below two dogs. I was partially suprised how easily the slab propagated laterally across the starting zone. Good lesson in spatial variability for me as ski cuts on similar aspects in Silver were not reactive, however I did note a skier triggered slab of the same depth in Grizzly right below the houses there. Weather was light winds and moderate snowfall.",

There was definitely snow being transported by wind and what looked like a decent sized slide halfway down the Seagull on Tuscarora.\nOur only first hand experience was down low in Brighton - a narrow and steep chute. Ski cut at the top produced a heavy wet slide at our feet taking the full width of the chute and all the new snow. It gouged into the old snow but did not step down. The slide moved slowly and ran out after 100-150 vertical. No one was caught, no one was below.  We had started to observe roller balls in the new snow and were on our way out while taking extra care when this took place. ",

Late in the afternoon, they're headed back to their RV at the Bear River Trailhead and decide to play around on a popular slope in Gold Hill Basin. At approx 17:15 Ryan climbs a north facing slope and triggers a slide which breaks well above him as he's low on the slope. He's caught, carried, and consequently buried several feet deep on a benched terrain feature where the bulk of the debris stacks up. Kevin begins a beacon search, locates his brother, and begins CPR. About 20 minutes elapse when Kevin flags down a local rider and his son who assist in the rescue and notify local SAR. CPR continues for an additional 20 more minutes. While heroic efforts are made to save Ryan's life, medical crews pronounce him dead at the scene.\n\n\n\nDebris stacked up deeply on this bench feature.

Looking at an entry track and given the snowpack structure, we speculate the slide was triggered low on the path, on a portion of the slope nearing 36 degrees.

January 10th brought strong winds, heavy snow, and a widespread avalanche cycle with many slopes breaking deep and wide. A break in the action revealed an impressive avy cycle throughout the range, but many slopes remained intact. February 7th brought the next round of heavy snow, record water totals, and raging winds. \n\nThe range has remained incredibly active since mid January. Historically large and destructive avalanches breaking to the ground have become the norm. While there have been many close calls, this relatively small avalanche combined with steep terrain resulted in a tragic accident.\n\n ",

        "Comments 1": "Correction to Bruce Tremper's report about the 2nd slide on Superior on April 27th.  We skied Holy Toledo then traversed to the regular ridge approach up Superior, at the saddle well west of Little Superior.  We skied the north face of Superior, then skinned back to the ridge via our existing skin track.  We then traversed east to the Black Knob with the intention of skiing north aspects into Cardiff, and exiting Pole Line.    As we skinned east (not booting west, as Bruce wrote), we stayed on the north aspect of the ridge.   As we approached our descent location for the north aspect of The Black Knob, one of use peered over the south face.  There was literally no more than 6\" of ski on the ridge crest when the slide broke out directly from the top of the crest.  There was no cornice in this area.  We had no intention of being on the south face this day, especially at noon after watching other skier triggered slides two hours prior.  The south face certainly changed dramatically with daytime heating.  This soft slab acted like it was sitting on top of Teflon, and was essentially remotely triggered with no skier on the slope when it broke.

        "Comments 2": " Slides like these were commonplace along the route along the Cutler ridge. 2-3' deep and 150' across. Hard slab, heavily wind-loaded. Upon inspection, one could tell that there were multiple failure planes within the storm snow and from the windloading. The cracks on the bed surface demonstrated that the avalanche and load had collapsed the 5\" thick old rain crust and wanted to run near the ground. Unfortunately, too much tensile and compressive strength of the 'slab' kept it in place. ",

Also, the sun poked out at times, which may have added to the stress.",

There was a solo skier doing laps in the bowl, must have come from the Colonies or the Canyons not sure which, he was working on his fourth run when he tickled the wind load in the starting zone a little too much, the slide broke out above him on his 4th turn in, we gave a yell and he skied to the side of it and let it pass. The weak layer was well developed facets on the ground, this same spot has avalanched to the ground multiple time this year. Largest part of the crown was about 3ft deep, and around 80 ft wide at it's widest point, ran to the flats at the bottom.\n\nPhotos: Crown, run out, bed surface, and the facets at the ground which it ran on.\n",

        "Comments 1": "Biggest problem wasn't the avalanche itself, but the group of 3 skiers who dropped right down the gut of the ~150feet of hangfire above me while I dug my snow test pit. I clearly communicated that they needed to wait until I was out from under the hangfire, but they dropped and centerpunched it anyways. They broke out deltas from the slab, but luckily didn't drop the whole upper portion of the slope, as it would have come down right on top of me. \n\nWhen I got to the bottom and told them what they had done was NOT COOL, they belittled my avi experience (I'm avi 1 & 2 certified), and said that when I eventually know what I'm doing, I'll understand why they were right to ski down on top of me in very clear avalanche conditions. Pissed me off to no end that they would assume I'm some Jerry, and try to make me feel bad about their disregard of standard BC etiquette and safety protocol. \n\nIf you were part of the irresponsible trio that dropped on top of me from Sunset at about 2:40 pm and then climbed Tuscarora afterwards, shame on you.",

I ski cut in over a small convexity towards a tree on the slope. The soft \"pop\" of the fracture shooting forward and backward of my skis wasn't super loud. At first, the crack and slide was limited to 20 to 30 feet in front of and behind be, leaving me standing comfortably on the bed surface. After sliding down 50 feet or so, it propagated across the entire slope, and everything below me slid. It only looked to get going 30 mph or so, maybe a little faster when it funneled into the small gully at the bottom. The debris pile looked to be 3 to 4 feet deep, and ran full track, nearly to Lake Catherine.",

        "Comments 1": "Spotted this avalanche on Yamaha Hill driving to the forest today.    Sled problems prevented me from getting photos and a closer look, so this is all from the highway using binoculars.  Thinking a rider from the weekend triggered this avalanche low on the slope or from the side where the slab is thinner and weaker.  Looking back a few days on the winds from nearby Windy Peak and with plenty of loose snow on the surface to blow around, this slope was fairly wind loaded and waiting for a trigger.  This slope is very typical western Uintas with large open terrain on the windward side  where winds can grab lots of snow and deposit onto the leeward side.  The avalanche broke into weak snow near the ground, dirt and vegetation was easily seen on the bed surface. ",

Naturals also occured down the main chutes in the canyon traveling what appeared to be 300+ feet. You wouldn't want to be caught in that terrain trap with conditions less than ideal. There was also aproximately 2-3\" thick of hard crust on the top layer from wet snowfall/temps rising. Not exactly a great ride down, except in the trees up high, but worth going to see current conditions. Only saw a couple other ski tracks, looks like everyone was being cautious and avoiding the main open chutes, be safe & have fun out there\n",

        "Comments 1": "After enjoying a day filled with beautiful Utah powder, my group skied Room of Doom and decided that one more lap up in Mineral Fork would be an excellent way to end an excellent day. We were all tired but on a high from the excellent skiing. It was my turn to break trail, so I started to put in the skintrack up what is known as 'Santiago' in Mineral Fork. Santiago is relatively steep (upper 30s) and is directly northeast facing. My partner and I had skied it a few weeks prior during our dry spell and we commented how the skiing was excellent because it was entirely faceted (red flag). \n\n \n\nShortly after starting up the run, I felt a collapse, heard a whomp, and saw some shooting cracks above me. Spooked, I yelled back to my partners about what I had experienced. Being on a powder high after a long day, one of my partners urged me to continue, as this was surely an anomoly. Everything so far had been rock solid. I thought about it, and generally agreed that everything else we had skied had been very stable. My friend is generally right in these situations, so I went against my gut and continued. \n\n \n\n15 yards later, I felt another collapse, and slowly the snow around me began to slide. Not knowing the extent of the avalanche, I tried to just skin out of it. It became clear that wasn't going to happen. I beared down on the bed surface, deployed my airbag and held on for dear life. Luckily, I was able to hold on and only lost a ski pole. The avalanche ran to where the slope mellowed out. \n\n \n\nThis avalanche happened in a relatively protected area. If it had happened 200 yards up the slope, we would have been on a much bigger face and the consequences could have easily been dire for me (and likely my two partners). While everyone came away unscathed, this could have easily been a very serious incident. \n\n \n\nMy group debriefed the situation and we all learned a lot from this. The takeaway message... if you experience signs of instability (like I did), trust yourself and be firm in making a safe decision for the group. \n",

        "Comments 1": "We stumbled onto an interesting avalanche today at the Ant Knolls.  To me, the most likely trigger seemed like a sledder while hill climbing.  It could have been natural but it doesn't make much sense since there was no significant new snow load and no new wind loading on that particular slope.  There was just a skiff of new snow on the bed surface indicating it probably released Sunday.\nThe weakness was facets below a fairly thick melt freeze crust.  It appears that most of this terrain avalanched in the January cycle leaving a very shallow weak snowpack.  The faceted layer was VERY loose.  \nThroughout the day, the only other activity that we saw was very minor, small pockets within the new snow that probably released Sunday when the wind picked up.  There was some wind effect along the higher terrain with some larger pillows noted.",

        "Comments 1": "Saw three avalanches while climbing up the ridge alongside Northeast Bowl this am: one broke where the bowl rolls over to 30°+ on the skier's right side of the bowl (hard to see but seems to have run 100+ feet with a crown of roughly 3 feet), another in the gully to skier's right of the bowl (which appears to have slid prior to Sunday's snow, and ran much farther than I've seen it slide before, perhaps 200+ feet), and the third right off the top of true 10420 peak (slid down to the trees below the peak and seemed to have a crown of 2-3 feet). Except for the gully shot, all seem to have slid during the high PI event on Sunday. \n\n \n\nNothing particularly surprising in any of these: all broke on steeper terrain, and none needed a skier to trigger them. Just a healthy reminder that with this snowpack, it's not a matter of *if* things will slide but *when* on anything E-N-W. I've yet to see anything over 30° that did *not* slide when a skier touched it or got close. Fun times in the Wasatch. \n",

        "Comments 1": " \n\nThis snowmobile triggered slide occurred at approximately 1200 moments before we arrived. The crown depth ranged from 2 feet to 6 feet where it was wind loaded near the cornices. On the edges of the flank below the ridge a little bit, snowpack depth was 3.2 feet which is very shallow. This path likely ran in late December based on this shallow snowpack depth.\n\nThe rider had climbed through a clearing in the trees to the lookers left of the path. Near the ridge top he sidehilled to the west in order to descend an open area. There were a few rocks poking through the snow (evidence of a thin snowpack) and he slowed down a bit. Then he saw the slope fracture. He instantly deployed his air bag back pack then turned down hill and tried to escape the avalanche.\n\nHe feathered/pumped the throttle attempting to get off the slab but it kept fracturing in front of him. About 1/3-1/2 way down the slope, he began rising up what felt like 10 feet in the air. He was afraid that his sled would then nose dive, so he hit the throttle to keep the nose of his sled up and maintain control of the sled. As he move further down slope with the avalanche, he was engulfed in the powder cloud and couldn't see anything. He pinned the throttle again and shot out of the powder cloud and ahead of the avalanche debris.\n\nHe and his two partners all carried avalanche rescue gear (avalanche beacons, shovels, probes and air bag back packs). His partners were in a safe location when the avalanche occurred. They had attended a recent avalanche awareness talk given by the Utah Avalanche Center forecaster assigned to this zone. Additionally they had read the advisory for the day and remembered the danger being mostly LOW with a few areas that included slopes like this one as being MODERATE.\n\nAir bag comments: It is remarkable that this rider was able to inflate his air bag AND maintain control of his sled to escape the avalanche. Many other riders have time to do one or the other. Additionally he was wearing the type of air bag that inflates around the head, neck and shoulders (presumably to prevent trauma to the head and neck). He reported that his focus was down hill in front of the sled, and the air bag did not in any way block his vision.\n\nPhoto below of the avalanche. Other riders had climbed the slope to the right of the avalanche. The up track of the rider who triggered this slide can  be seen to the left of the avalanche.\n",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": " \n\nTwo skiers went for a late afternoon ski tour near Electric Lake. They made at least one run down a low angle northeast facing slope. They ascended a ridgeline and for their last run chose a steeper northeast facing slope. The first skier successfully skied to the bottom and waited for his partner out of sight of the slope. When his partner did not show up, he climbed back up a short distance and found an avalanche. He did a quick search on the surface of the avalanche debris but did not find his partner or any clues. They were not wearing avalanche transceivers, and he called for help. The victim was not carrying a shovel or probe. His partner likely did not have either, but it is unclear.\n\nEmery and Sanpete County search and rescue arrived at the scene around 8pm. Inability to assess avalanche danger on adjacent slopes, mainly due to darkness, did not allow the rescue teams to get onto the debris. A helicopter searched from the air with spot lights. At midnight the decision was made to regroup Saturday morning and continue the search. \n\nOn Saturday, January 19 the search resumed under the command of Emery County Sheriff's Office. Explosives were used to make the scene safe and ensure more avalanches would not occur. People were staged near the avalanche debris in anticipation of performing a probe line. Searchers on skis started at the top of the debris field using a RECCO device and an avalanche search dog. The search dog located the approximate location of the victim which was confirmed with and avalanche probe at approximately noon on January 19. The victim was buried a maximum of a meter deep and was found in a prone position facing downhill.\n\nMore information and photos has been posted by the Emery County Sheriff's Office HERE.\n\n \n\nLocation of crown where skier tracks enter: 39.63333 -111.25038, elevation 9520\n\nBurial location: 39.63400 -111.24742, elevation 9,080\n\nToe of debris: elevation 8,900 ft (approx.)\n\nWhile the vertical drop was about 600 feet, the slope distance this avalanche ran was 1,500 feet.",

Any slope with recent deposits of wind drifted snow should be avoided.\"  \n\nSince January 7th, and before the accident, the Skyline avalanche reports included 12 slab avalanches, averaging 2' deep and 200' wide.  Nine of the twelve involved faceted snow layers.  A 'heat map' of the activity is found below, depicting the pattern of the avalanche activity on an aspect/elevation diagram.\n",

All of us at the Utah Avalanche Center have had our own close calls and know how easy it is to make mistakes. No one is immune to this.\n\nHere are a few things we can learn:\n\nThis is the third avalanche fatality this winter in the United States where the victim was not wearing an avalanche transceiver. Your chances for surviving an avalanche burial are greatly increased if you wear an avalanche transceiver.\n\nIt is important to always keep an eye on your partner when they are descending avalanche terrain. This way you are quickly aware of an avalanche if one releases. If you are watching your partner when they are caught in an avalanche you have a better chance of knowing where to start your rescue effort which ultimately saves time. Time is crucial as statistics show - the greatest success of live recoveries happens within about 15 minutes of burial.\n\nThe part of the slope where these skier descended seemed fairly benign compared to the rest of the slope. It was 31 degrees in steepness where they started their descent. There was a short rollover that reached 37 degrees. Our perceptions of hazard can vary a lot, but the most important terrain factor for avalanches is slope angle.\n\n\n\nThis search and recovery was performed by Emery County Sheriff's Office and SAR, Sanpete County Sheriff's Office and SAR, Utah Department of Public Safety, Utah Division of Natural Resources, Utah Department of Transportation, Alta Ski Patrol, Forest Service LEO's, and the Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center.\n\n",

The accident took place on a steep northeast facing slope at 9500'. \n\nAspect ranges from due east to northeast.\n\nThere were many undulations in the bed surface. Many of these were caused by large rocks. It was notable while walking on the bed surface how \"rolly\" it was with many partially covered rocks. These can often serve as good trigger points where the snowpack is a bit shallower. A few of these rocks can been seen in the second photo below. ",

        "Weather Conditions and History": "We measure snowfall in terms of the snow water equivalent (SWE). In other words, its how much water the snow contains. If you melted the snow, how many of inches of water would it be. From an avalanche perspective, we don't care how much snow fell. We care how much weight was added to the snowpack. More weight = more stress. The more you stress something, the more likely it will break. When the snowpack is stressed and breaks, it produces avalanches. A rough guide is that 1 inch of SWE is about 10-12 inches of snow.\nSnowfall history can be broken down into three periods:\n\n\n\tSome snow fell in October which remained on upper elevation north facing slopes but the the snowpack started forming in most places around November 21 through December 3 when snow containing 6.7 inches of water accumulated and formed the base of the snowpack. \n\tSome snow fell between December 3 and December 22 with more significant storms around Christmas and New Years. More importantly during this time, there was a notable dry period. This clear, cold weather created weak, faceted snow (aka - sugar snow) near the surface. The weak layer which this avalanche fractured into was formed between Dec 13 and Dec 22.\n\tSignificant snowfall returned on January 6 when a 2 day storm delivered 15 inches of snow containing 1.6 inches of water. The next period of snow occurred from January 15 and ended just a few hours before this accident occurred. Snow from this storm was 12 inches containing 1.4 inches of water. These were manual snow measurements from a snow study plot very near the Electric Lake dam which is 3 miles SSE of the accident. Data from Mammoth Cottonwood Snotel (5 miles NE of accident) is also provided in a chart below. Snow from these two storms was clearly evident in the crown face of this avalanche. In photos below you can see two distinct layers that made up the slab.\n\n\nTrees surrounding this accident site were still covered with snow at the time of the accident indicating minimal wind. However, this slope may have been loaded by strong southwest winds that wrapped around this slope and cross loaded it during a period of very strong winds late on the night of Jan 17. At that time winds averaged 40-50 mph with gusts of 50-60 mph. Much of the avalanche activity occurring in this area prior to January 15 happened on wind loaded slopes. An avalanche in Rolfson Canyon was a good example.\n\n \n",

        "Comments 1": "Triggered a small slide around 9000' descending from Raymond Glade this morning. It was windy breaking trail on the way up, but there didn't seem to be a huge amount of transport. I had seen some slight cracking above ~9300', but nothing that shot more than about a foot. Descending the upper wooded headwall there was predictable sluffing, the main shot in the bowl skied normally. I opted for a WNW facing steeper exit to the gentle aspen glade below, without thinking much of it honestly. I ski cut it as always, expecting perhaps a somewhat longer-running sluff, and was a bit surprised to trigger a small soft slab avalanche. It began in the narrow choke immediately below my skis and propagated somewhat enthusiastically out on both sides as it went down, running all the way to the aspens below. It wasn't very deep, maybe 6\" at most, and wouldn't have been enough to do any harm in the terrain I was in, but it did run probably 200' vertically, until the terrain reduced in angle quite a bit. I obviously hadn't ascended this route so I didn't get a great look at the snow conditions before it went, it seemed like just the new snow, but hard to say it wasn't wind loaded too, as the wind was changing directions all morning. I descended the bedsurface and took some pictures, sorry for the poor quality, visibility was quite poor at this time (~8am), it was snowing steadily and there was a fair bit of wind. Having ski cut this exact shot many times this season with no more result than light sluffing I was a bit surprised to be honest, particularly at this aspect/elevation.\n",

        "Comments 1": "Skiing a NW chute off the far skier right side of Wolverine Cirque I triggered a soft slab avalanche failing on the interface between the roughly 12\" of new snow and the layer beneath it. The first fracture broke at the top of the line in what appeared to be a small pocket of wind loaded snow.  As I skied in front of this relatively small amount of moving snow a sequence of 4-5 additional fractures broke in front of me as I skied as quickly as possible th rest of the way down the chute.  As I neared the exit of the chute to the apron several more fractures propagated in front of and around me.  Fortunately I was able to stay on my feet throughout all of this and carry enough forward momentum to outpace the moving snow.  In reviewing the incident, it appeared the slide would have been unlikely to result in a full burial but easily could have become dangerous in hazardous terrain, or perhaps with differnt timing in the same area.\n\n \n\nThis occurred at around 2pm.  While it was overcast at this time and had been intermittently cloudy for the previous few hours it seemed that this slope had received enough sun to make it more reactive than neighboring lines off the cirque.  Additionally there appeared to be wind loading at the top of the line, and possibly in some areas lower down.  \n\n \n\n \n",

        "Comments 1": "These slides occurred in the hells canyon area in the Snowbasin side country called \"The toilet bowl\"  3 slides total, all running quite fast! faster than a normal wet side. entrenching  the ground and involving a lot of snow. Most were initiated by roller balls from ski cuts and propogated after roller balls were about basket ball size, sympathetic release on slide walls once debris pile passed. Special note on the 3rd slide, In my set up of a rescue senario for my avy class i experimented in deployment of my dummy Bil (blue shop cover all's) and filled him with snow (approx 70 lbs) tossed him down the slop and after flopping over once and 5-10 sec later he was off to the races.... took some impressive tumbles getting caught in a terrain trap and ended up getting wiped out by the post release from the upper side walls. the debris pile i couldn't ask for more for my class 75' wide and 100' long.\nThere is a unedenifyable weak layer in the snow pack that I believe played apart in the speed and amount of snow that was entrained the temp was around 40 deg f. its been along time since I've seen wet slides like this in march.  Hoping to find this week layer sat during our class check back then.....",

        "Comments 1": "Forecaster Comments: Alta has not opened for the season yet.\n\n\n\nWent up to Alta today to take a look at Main Chute on Baldy. I've had good early season success skiing that there, so we skinned up to the top of Collins to scout it, and thinking it looked relatively filled in, decided to climb up to the top of Mt. Baldy for Main Chute via Sugarloaf Pass. At the top, there was obvious wind loading on the line, but the pillow of wind loaded snow looked relatively shallow, isolated and manageable. We did not see any other tracks around the area leading to the chute or apron, so I decided to drop in and do a ski cut. A soft storm/light wind slab pulled out at my feet ripping across the length of the chute 8 to 10 inches deep. It continued down the length of the line, propagating along the width of the chute on its way down. It started slowly, and looked like it would stop, so I was surprised to see it pick up steam on the way down. I knew there had been some wind loading, but I thought the ski cut would result in a more isolated pocket pulling out. The snowpack had a bit of an upside down feeling to it. We continued down the chute, and for the first few turns, the bed surface was consolated snow that was skiable. Then, halfway down, the bed surface became more sugary, unconsoladated snow and quite rocky. Perhaps we were overly optimistic about the amount and density of new snow in the Wasatch when we decided to drop into Main Chute this morning, but I felt able to manage the ski cut and the risk appropriately. It's always a good reminder to ensure that there is no one below you when you do a ski cut at a heavily trafficed area (we were certain that there was no one in the line when we dropped in, but Main Chute has a blind turn in the middle, so we couldn't see the apron and runout zone.) Also, a small avalanche has big consequences this time of year, with the capacity to cheese grater you over some sharky rocks, so take care. I suspect this wind slab/new storm snow will stabilize within 24 to 48 hours, but on the upper elevation north facing terrain, the old snow will continue to be a problem for awhile.\n",

        "Comments 1": "Morning started off sunny warm, and only slightly breezy. By noonish clouds rolled in and the wind started blowing moderate to strong out of the west. The wind was moving around lots of snow.  We skied our first lap in two dogs. There was was an avalanche that ran from below a cornice and propagated about 75ft wide and 6-12inches deep and ran through some trees and almost to the bottom, approximately 500ft. It was on a NE aspect ~35degrees at the start zone.  There were numerous other avalanches around that had been skier triggered. One in cardiff that ran around 9am and one in Toledo chute that ran around 1030am. I am assuming that both were intentionally triggered and hopefully the skier will post their own report. The Toledo Chute one was particularly impressive as both the main chute and the alternate chute lookers left both propagated wall to wall about 8-10 inches deep, it looked like from across the way.

About halfway down the ridge there is a cornice that is almost always there getting cross-loaded. And this specific area often runs. (see: http://utahavalanchecenter.org/avalanches/20524). \n I pushed a small piece of the cornice off and it just slid 20 feet or so. So I jumped on the slab below the cornice doing a quick slope cut and skiing off the slab. The slope propagate ~100ft along the cornice and proceeded to run ~300ft down to just above the trees below. Looking at the bed surface there was a thin layer of grauple on top of about an inch of snow that had bonded well to the old hard melt freeze crust.  Looking at the crown there are two distinct layer of snow. I am guessing the top is the new wind load from today and the bottom is the new snow from yesterday, though I was not able to take a closer look. \n\n\npicture 1: crown with 2 distinct weak layers\n\npicture 2: grauple layer causing the heightened instability today\n\npicture 3: poor picture of the avalanche from below (vis had gotten pretty bad)",

Remote triggered the rollover/gully on So Long's right side from a tree row between So Long and Sunset. Wind was transporting snow from skiers left So Long to gullies on right into soft slab. Continued down tree row and noticed next gully over to northeast previously avalanched. It had been snowed on so maybe last night due to steeper slope? I followed a filled-in skinner so maybe skier triggered? Didn't check out the crowns on account of being a bit spooked and hitting rocks. Photos didn't come out due to blowing snow.",

Each of my turns off the top released storm snow that ran on the firm crust and, given the steepness of the slope, gained speed and accumulated to approximately 2+ feet deep when it passed me by just above the choke at around 9500 feet. I cut right and came down through the normal 2 trees exit. The slide came down the cliffs below the 2 trees choke and spread out for a couple hundred feet.

        "Comments 1": "Feeling very dumb and very fortunate. I knew better. I continued upward where I know it to be around 30°. I didn't even look at the forecast. I assumed some things and allowed my life distractions to be priority over evaluating my approach and Target. I was heading up at about 9700 ft when a disturbing sound occurred, like a muffled explosion like you might hear in the distance on a control morning at a nearby resort. I began back stepping and the snowpack started downward with another loud growl. I had just kick turned by a small group of pines and was two or three strides up from there. I backtracked and was fortunate enough to grab a couple handfuls of just stout enough boughs and was right on the edge of the slide path as it flowed over and past me trying to pull me down with it. The crown was easily 200 feet above me. \n\nI believe the slope to be more like 34/36° now, based on comparing the lines on my pole as I came back down. I should not have been there.\n\nIt was big and down to the ground, very thin faceted layer, presumably the October rot.\n\nYes. I was alone. I know. Never again. I am Lucky to be alive.\n",

Some of the snowmobilers became stuck and one person circled uphill and to the side of them to come help. He triggered the avalanche that buried him but the avalanche did not catch the stuck snowmobilers. They other snowmobilers began rescue efforts immediately but the victim was buried 6-8 feet deep and it took 20 minutes to extricate him. They began CPR but he did not respond.\n\nThe victim was Clinton Conover of Ferron, Utah. Everyone at the Utah Avalanche Center's hearts go out to the family and friends of the victim of this tragic accident.\n\n\n\nClinton was found just uphill of his sled,\n\n\n\nMany thanks to Larry and Jonathan from Utah State Parks. While Cody and I investigated the avalanche, these guys probed for the sled, found it, and we all teamed up to dig it out and ultimately, get it back to family members.",

Pretty consistent westerly winds with frontal passage today, graupel filled in tracks and was not real coherent to the existing rain/wind crust.

He was buried approximately 1000 feet below the ridge under 2 to 3 feet of debris. He was located by his partner with a beacon. Davis County Search and Rescue responded and the victim was extricated via helicopter.\n\nRecent snow coupled with strong winds on Saturday caused snow to be drifted into deep drifts on the lee sides of ridges.

Crown varied from 4 to 2 feet deep, 175-200ft wide running to the flats at the bottom. The slide pulled out to the ground interface, and the only thing left in the bed surface was about an inch or two of rotten faceted snow, and dirt and rocks. Massive wind loading for 2 straight days finally over loaded the slope, with some help from a cornice fall. Photos, a few of the crown, and the slide path. Good call on the hazard today, if slopes like this are ripping out mid afternoon naturally the hazard is definitely high.\n",

        "Comments 1": "\nWent up to assess the large avalanches that occurred last week in Woolly Hole and Pika Cirque, and possibly get a crown profile from Woolly. Plan was to ascend the debris pile and avy path, avoiding the hanging snowfield to the west, which had not slid as everything else had during the past storm. We were hoping to ski a few inches of recycled, wind deposited pow on the bed surface that had slid on the PWL the in the days prior.\n\n \n\nWe saw evidence of apocalyptic slides on the persistent weak layer in both Woolly Hole and Pika Cirque that had run full track to the flats near the campground. There were new, broken trees 6-8” in diameter scattered about the deposition zone. Based on the debris it appears enormous soft slabs had run to the flats, and we estimated crowns to be 6-8 feet deep.\n\n \n\nWe noticed significant wind transport and spindrift on the bench above and especially the high ridges as we ascended the lower headwall, as well as two avalanches in new and wind deposited snow that released from the north facing, hanging snowfield west of our ascent route as we traveled uphill. In places where the terrain turned east we found 1” dinner plate wind slabs that would crack on top of the bed surface but weren’t deep or cohesive enough to run.\n\n \n\nWe switched to bootpacking for the final 150 feet towards the bench beneath Woolly hole, kicking steps 1-2” into firm, scoured snow on the flank of the shallow couloir. Then I kicked a step that was hollow up to my knee and released a 12-15” deep wind slab that broke 50-60’ above us and about 50’ wide. It only ran 100-200’ before stopping and neither of us were carried. Terrain was north facing just shy of 9,000 feet, 40-45 degrees where the isolated wind slab was.\n\n \n\nWith that bright red flag and increasing wind transport above we decided to call it a day and skied down nice, recycled north facing powder back to the campground and the car. We should have anticipated more irregular wind loading with the levels of transport we were seeing and been a bit more vigilant about pockety, isolated wind slabs even in the absence of PWL hazard due to the recent large slides.\n\nWith a substantial storm on the horizon we should assume the PWL will become active again as a slab builds on top of the faceted snow on the be surface. Increasing winds ahead of the front will also heighten wind slab danger in a thin, rocky snowpack.  \n\n",

The soft slab broke near the cliff face, well above the descending snowboarder, and caught up to him as he was turning out of the slide path and into the trees, knocking him off of his feet and pressing him into a small pine tree. The toe of the debris was between 2-3' deep. We did a beacon search to determine that no one else was involved(we did not see or hear anyone in the area, but the debris covered a previous groups tracks) and alerted Solitude Ski Patrol of the incident after exiting Silver Fork.

M&M drainage is a perfect, natural, leeward fetch, which loads during storms with big westerly winds. While not particularly uniform, most of the terrain had some degree of weak, old, early season snow. The avalanches I cataloged, were surprisingly wide and connected... a couple hundred feet in width.... breaking 3'-4' deep, failing on weak snow near the ground, and running great distances.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

On our return to the parking lot we observed through binoculars three distinct point avalanches on the west slopes to the west of where we hiked.\n\n \n\nsecond on our descent towards the second Hemongog above Alpine I was sliding down the hillside on a 30 degree slope. I started pushing a large amount of snow which broke loose from the ice layer below it. The layer was 6 to 12 inches deep. The top layer completely detached from a point where my snow shoes plowed it. It quickly grew wider and carried me with it. I rode it for a while then rolled off whereupon it kept going for a few seconds and the stopped. The result was very large. I had broken loose a slab about 10-14 feet wide and about 100 feet down slope. It was about 6-12 inches deep and did not bond whelk with the ice layer below. If the slope had been steeper it would have gone really fast and lost control. I only have a photo of the slab break that I rode which I will try to attach. \n",

We (unintentionally but not unexpectedly as there was already debris around from a previous skier triggered slide) triggered 2 slides - soft slab, 30cm deep, running on buried SH, they joined together to form a debris pile 100m wide and about 75m in length.  My partner triggered the first near the ridge top on a slope approaching 35 degrees and I triggered the second beside, and 50 feet below, the 1st slide.\nSlope angle is everything - the slope was mostly planar but the slightest rollover approaching 35 degrees was enough to tip the balance.",

        "Comments 1": "Today while ascending the low-angle shoulder directly south of Scotts Pass to Pt. 9800, I remotely triggered an avalanche from roughly 50 meters away into the NE bowl above Scotts Pass. The avalanche initially released 3-4' deep on a layer of facets, and spread across much of the bowl with crown depths up to 5' deep. The avalanche broke 600' wide and ran 500' down the slope into the flats. Due to the amount of hangfire, I did not measure debris depths but I would assume debris stacked up fairly deep. Plenty of cracks could be seen on sections of the slope that did not slide, and I would imagine these hanging slabs might go soon. The area was free and clear of any tracks and people.\n\n \n\nThis avalanche broke on my second ascent up the shoulder, having already put in a skin track.\n",

Cornice triggered a wind slab when it hit the slope below, which then triggered a persistent slab in an area that had previously slide. Slide then propagated out across the slope. Total width ended up being approximately 800 feet wide, with an average crown depth of 4 feet. Ran approximately 500 vertical, taking out several trees on the way. This is an area that had shown a relatively strong, but highly variable snowpack. Up to this point, there has not been a connected slab. However, iwarming and wind loading created a more connected slab. Natural avalanche activity in adjacent drainages (see separate avalanche observation) shows that other slopes are in the same situation. Photos below show the crown (taken from near the center looking both directions) and debris.\n",

Crown was about a hundred feet off the ridge line. By the looks of it a cornice dropped off the ridge and hit a wind loaded depression on the slope. Crown was between 50 and 75ft wide, probably 6 to 7 feet deep at its deepest point, ran full track to the valley floor about 1200 vertical FT, did not get close enough for exact diameters, quite a bit of hang fire above. From the looks of it probably ran either the morning of the 25th or the night of the 24th. Suspected the weak layer to be somewhere around the MLK rain crust, quite a large debris pile at the bottom. Sorry for the dark pics it was starting to cloud up.",

This avalanche released on the rock slabs above the DB then went through the narrow funnel in the top of the run and fanned out on the main slope running down 3/4 of the path, there was also a separate glide avalanche skiers right on the DB. The slide ran over 1200ft taking rocks with it. The main slide buried part of my up track and one of my down tracks from Tuesday under 20ft of ice and snow in the deposition zone. Four plus days of warmer temperatures and humid wet air, not to mention 6 plus feet of snow in the last few weeks finally snapped the rubber band on these polished rock slabs and created a destructive and non-survivable rock, ice and snow avalanche. There are still many yawning glide cracks on Bonkers and the Blue Ice that have not released and need to be given respect until the temperature drops and these spring like conditions cease. \nphotos: the main slide, a crown from a separate slide in the same area and a video of the debris field.\n",

Both Naturals and Human Triggered Slides were reported. A Natural Cycle appeared to occur in the Millicent Bowl some time just after noon. Multiple slopes had releases of up to 12 inches deep with the majority 8 inches deep. The Millicent Bowl has yet to be opened this season and is un-skied terrain. In addition multiple Human Triggered slides were reported with remote triggering initiating each occurrence. Slides were easily triggered just by just approaching steep roll overs and or ridgeline break-overs from a safe distances away from the steep terrain. The majority of these slides were similar in depth to the Natural activity observed in the Millicent Bowl area with depths of slides ranging from 8 inches to 10 inches. Slides were running to transitions and were all new snow slides that appeared to be at the interface of the latest impulse that initiated at 0600 on Saturday the 10th.  \n",

Slab failed initially on mid-pack facets approximately 60 cm down from the surface. However, as the slab ran it stepped down into deeper weak layers, ultimately stepping down to the ground. \n\nThis slab illustrates our current avalanche hazard pretty well. Most slopes are stable and you can ride a lot of places. In fact we have skied areas right next to this slope. However, you can still trigger avalanches in specific terrain. Which is the definition of a moderate hazard (\"heightened avalanche conditions on specific terrain features, evaluate snow and terrain carefully; identify features of concern\"). Features of concern right now are steep northerly facing slopes that are weak and thin due to rocks, previous avalanches, etc.\n",

Nothing went but that didn't change our plans. Both of us took turns skiing down favoring just east of the ridge in soft snow. Small cornices had formed on the east side of the ridge partway down - we avoided them. After re-grouping at about the 9500' elevation, Skier 1 started down a small section of steeper angle just east of the ridge and it immediately broke on a wind-loaded rollover section with the initial crown about 50' in length 5' behind skier. Skier 2 immediately yelled to notify and the triggering skier and Skier 1 angled back to the top of the ridge to avoid the avalanche. The slide propagated to about 75-100 ft wide and ran down hitting a roller and continuing over to run a total of about 800 ft. We had seen no one else in the area above or below us. We worked our way down to the base to observe.\n\nWarm temperatures. Flat light. Overcast. Slight wind (more up top.)\n",

          "Comments 1": "Party of four. Skinned up Emmas approx 9:30 am. Skied Hideway, small slow push-avalanches witnessed with short running lengths. Heavy wet snow coming down all day. Many discussions about safe travel and safe protocols. Also winds from last night were a hot topic.  Established skinner up ridge separating Main Days and Upper days with the objective of skiing Main Days. At the top skiing tactics were discussed. Skier 1 ski cut across small gully to a sub ridge with a small stand of trees. Skier 2 cut just above tracks to spot next to him. Skier 3 cut higher still and crossed a steeper section close to the main ridge. He triggered a wind slab that propagated up to the main ridge. Avalanche triggered up slope approx 8 feet. I yelled out a warning. Skier 1 was \"sat down\" Skier 2 carried 10 feet. Skier 3 carried 20 feet. No burials everyone self arrested on the hard bed surface. Out of my sight (Skier 4 still on main ridge) the avalanche crown ran approx 700 feet plus along the main ridge to the west. As the slide ran it stepped down into the old wet snow and ran into the gully. Entraining old wet snow the slide ran to the valley floor. Skiers 1,2,3 started to search the debris field. Made contact with a solo split boarder skinning on the main ridge. No signals detected. I stayed up and took pictures. Crown 6 inches to 1.5 feet. Wind loaded it ran on a very distinct crust. Team regrouped at the toe of the debris pile did one more search. Circled up did a debrief and went back to the car.\n\nLessons:\n\nSafe travel protocols were instrumental today. \n\nOur ski cuts (1 and 3) could have been better\n\nWe expected the ski cuts would produce a slide in the little gully. The results exceeded expectations.\n\nThe forecast was 100% correct today The slide Evelyn Lees predicted was the slide that happened\n\n \n",

The slab collapsed a length of 400ft but only two sections of it were overloaded enough to pull out and run.  The evidence showed a well-connected cohesive slab that formed from persistent south winds.\n\n \n\nNew snow was about 10 inches.  The new snow is super-glued to last week’s snow thanks to the wet entrance of the storm then light on top thanks to the wrap around we got after the front passed.  Most of last week’s snow melted on the dead south slopes so it was new snow on dirt again on the south side of the compass.  Shifting to the east side gave way to a impermeable curst layer under the new snow.  The low angle north side skied soft and fast.\n\n\n \n",

          "Comments 1": "Riding conditions in dry fork were incredible on Tuesday, April 16. The top layer of storm snow was a little dense, but still fluffy enough for over the windshield turns all day. After getting our fill on the sleds we made the decision to ski a sub ridge in the center of the drainage below the top of Alta's Supreme lift. The prominent aspect of the face is east, however there are more northerly and southerly pockets. My partner dropped a mid sized cliff into a small, northeasterly facing chute right around 10,000 feet in elevation. When he landed a small slab released and propagated a short distance along the bottom of the cliffs. The crown ranged from 1-2 feet in depth and was approximately 30-40 feet wide. In total the slide ran around 100 feet down the slope before it ran out of steam. We determined the angle of the slope to be 31° - 33° where it released. The pocket that released had most likely been a deposition zone for wind transported snow during the last storm. When loaded by the weight of the snowboarder it easily broke free. The slab showed no evidence of stepping down, failing only in the top layer and running on the harder crust underneath. \n\n \n\n \n",

Perhaps this area has been likely sliding a couple times this season and the one I probed had run earlier this winter given the shallowness. Either way impressive slide in Hideway Park. \n",

There were 2 additional avalanches in Hanks Canyon that probably occurred on Saturday night.   This slide ran 2810 ft based on an estimated release point.  When we discovered the slide, it was covered by 5 to 8 inches of new snow.   About 2/3 the way down from the crown, there was a pine tree in the middle of the avalanche path that had limbs broken by the avalanche that were 20 feet above the level of the current snow pack.  The attached picture shows a pine tree on the very edge of the avalanche that shows the depth of the avalanche to be about 12 feet. (Flagging and snow packed against the trunk of the tree.)",

Looks like similar timing.  \n\n \n\n[Forecaster Comment - Thank you for the observation. The avalanche was initially triggered by the helicopter landing at the top of Banana Belt, and that slide sympathetically released the two other avalanches in Main Days.]\n",

As expected we saw plenty of loose wet action on east facing slopes around 11am, some in the form of small avalanches slowly running a couple hundred feet and some in the form of thousands of snowballs peeling off the rocks at once. On our exit out redpine trees we looked back to pay homage to her majesty and saw a small wind slab Avalanche (likely skier triggered) on NE around 10,000.

          "Comments 1": "Saw a natural avalanche soon after it came rushing down the couloir directly SW of the main summit of Cascade Peak from about 10 miles away on I-15. Originally thought it was a fog cloud until I saw it picking up speed and rushing out of the bottom. I am assuming that it broke off near the summit where there would be significant windloading. The couloir to the flats is 4000ft and it ran that and likely another 500ft through the meadows by. I would not be surprised if we can find flattened trees down at the bottom later this year. The tail end of it likely blew by the hope campground or it may have even spilled up into it a bit. I am assuming that no one was in that slide path or in the run out on a day like today with the heightened avalanche risk. The crown was likely a few hundred feet wide and a few feet deep based off of the visibility of the slide from ~10 miles away.\n",

          "Comments 1": "I and my party of 3 others poked around Main Days, noticing firm wind slabs immediately off the ridge, but no amount of stomping from the top could get them to move. Since the snow was visibly softer and the slope mellows fairly quickly here, we decided we could manage this and still ski Main Days. We all skied the first run without an issue. We did notice cracking from the storm slab and we had small slabs release in a few steeper sections near the waterfall exit. Not enough to bury someone, and with a clean run out, we decided to go up for another lap and choose even mellower lines with forgiving run outs. \nOn the second lap, I cut further to the left where the slope was fairly mellow and I wasn't worried about anything breaking above me. However, the slope rolled over to about 38 degrees for a small section and as soon as I hit it the slope broke all around me. Interestingly, the snow was so soft I didn't feel a thing(in fact I didn't even know it was happening and kept skiing normally for probably 6-8 turns until I heard one of my partners yelling and I looked back and saw the snow chasing me and the crown where I had skied. I cut out to the left of the run out and all was fine. \nSince Main Days has only a few relatively short steep sections that have a real likelihood of sliding, we felt that we had a manageable avalanche problem. With how much cracking and small slabs we were popping out, I would say the old snow surface is bonding rather poorly, it might have started faceting a bit during this quieter period of weather, something to pay attention to the next few weeks.\n",

One of our party did a quick beacon search because there is a skin track to the lookers left of the avalanche, and ski/snowboard tracks exiting another chute on this slope, but found nothing. We didn't trust the unreleased snow above the debris, so did not search further. We did not see or hear anyone at the top of the slope either, so we moved on.\n\n \n\nOur best guess was a natural cornice fail with the new load and some daytime warming, which then released the storm slab on the graupel layer. I checked the snowpack nearby and found about 16\" of new snow on top of a very thin crust on top of well preserved graupel. The graupel likely pooled under these cliffs as well, making it even more reactive here.\n\n \n\n[Forecaster Comment: Seeing an avalanche and then performing a beacon check is a great example of looking out for one another in the backcountry.

The party triggered a huge hard slab avalanche, which buried and killed two close friends, 22-year-old Erik Jorgensen of Paradise and 23-year-old Jesse Johnson of Hyrum. \nThe avalanche was reported to authorities at around 10:30 am via satellite phone by a member of a separate snowmobiling party. About twenty snowmobilers, who were riding in the area, helped the surviving members of the party with the rescue attempt. From what I could piece together at the scene, one of the victims was very deeply buried in the heavy debris (10-12’ deep). The other was recovered in the vicinity of a grove of large spruce and fir trees. Survival of such a deep burial in avalanche deposition is extremely rare, and trauma due to impacting trees while carried by an avalanche accounts for around 25% of avalanche deaths in North America.\nThe victims were recovered with the aid of avalanche transceivers, which each wore, and probes and shovels. After previous avalanche incidents in the area, extra probes and shovels are cached at a nearby warming hut by Cache Search and Rescue (Cache County Sheriff) and local snowmobilers…. Members of CSAR and the flight crew of the responding Life Flight medical rescue helicopter were unable to resuscitate the two young men.",

          "Comments 1": "          Disappointed to report another unintentional skier triggered avalanche today in Mineral Fork, BCC on Mongo No. Could either be a soft slab (SS) or hard slab (HS) I can not come to a conclusion for sure. While it did have some blocky avalanche debris, I cannot confirm that the slab was 1F or harder.  I will call it a SS-ASu-R2-D2 that failed on what appeared to be 1.5mm facets on a North aspect at about 10k. Around 100ft wide, ran about 700ft and the crown depth was up to 3ft. Due to it breaking into old faceted snow we believe it was a Persistent Slab. \n\n\n          On the drive to LCC we made persistent slabs our number one concern today in the terrain we were traveling. We looked past a number of warning signs. These included finding a thin rocky snowpack on the entrance (facets), the fact that Mongo No had already slid this year, and seeing many avalanches on similar aspects and elevations. (Although we categorized those as storm/wind slabs that likely lost the energy by today.) We counted eight avalanches just from our view from the top of Mongo No. Just that alone should have kept us on more conservative terrain. We though that the structure was better than it was, and that there was less energy in the snowpack. We were wrong, the structure in that spot and I assume in many other rocky areas in Mineral was weaker than we figured.  This was also our third run of the day and I feel we had too much confidence brewing. Triggered from the skiers right flank of the slide.  \n\n          I was able to ski off the slab and out of harms way but the side was in unforgiving terrain and I was lucky. Booted up and out of that terrain and went down a lower angle slope that had a fatter and stronger snowpack where we stayed the rest of the day. Credit goes to UAC for the accurate forecast of persistent slab problem on high east aspects for the morning of 3/4/15. ​\n",

Original slide that was visible seems to have gone naturally or was remote triggered, but my best guess was natural during yesterday's high winds and PI. Crown broke 10' from the ridge and debris pile was down below in the tight trees. Not somewhere I'd want to take a ride. \n \n\nUpon exiting we were able to see 3 distinct crowns that were probably sympathetically triggered from the same event.  \n",

          "Comments 1": "We toured from Alta up and over into Cardiff and then into Mineral finishing in BCC. Winds were moderate gusting to strong above treeline in alpine zones all day, with winds ramping up in the afternoon around 1 pm as the front moved in and skies transitioned from clear to mostly cloudy. Winds were southerly and transporting snow onto northerly aspects, cross loading a lot of E and W facing terrain.  In the afternoon on our exit, winds picked up considerably, and cross loaded mid elevations resulting in touchy wind slabs on anything that was exposed out of the trees with a northerly tilt. Ski cuts in Room of Doom produced a small wind slab breaking at our feet ~4-7\" deep. Once we got into the mid elevations (9100'-9400') we remote triggered a small wind slab avalanche above us (4-6\" deep) on a WNW aspect. Descending the mineral gully we ski cut the NE gully sidewalls triggering a 4-8\" deep wind slab that propagated and traveled a decent ways down the gully. I believe these soft sensitive wind slabs were failing on lightly faceted snow. \n\n \n\nAbove treeline conditions on NW-E aspects were a mixture of firm wind board, wind slab, orange peel (faceted old wind slab) some light breakable wind crust, antitracks, sastrugi, and soft faceted wind pressed powder. E and W aspects were more wind damaged with some good skiing where orange peel was present.  Due N aspects held the best snow with the least wind effect.  Mid elevations in sheltered NW-E aspects held more faceted snow that was quite \"loud\" to ski through. These areas are most suspect for potential PWL reactivity with the next measurable snow fall.  In the am, SW and S held a much firmer breakable MFC. SE held a mixture of soft snow and MFC on SE in the am. Southerly and due W aspects warmed to a damp to wet surface during the day.\n\n \n\nThere is a decent sized glide crack in upper Room of Doom. \n\n \n\nOne other note, there are a lot of redundant and bold skin tracks up the middle of steep runs that are not typical ascent routes across the Wasatch right now. Typical ascent routes are used and repeated because they are more defensive, often more avalanche resistant, and safer, while also having the benefit of saving the best lines of snow to be skied and enjoyed, one at a time (while skiing and riding avy terrain). \n",

Person appeared to be riding down the Dog Lake Chutes and made a cross slope turn and initiated a wide/substantial Dry Loose Avalanche that dug down to the old snow new snow interface upon descent, and was at least 90 feet wide. Tracks rode out of the debris. The debris piled up to be at least 2 feet if not 3 and ran to the transition. Of note the entire rider's right half of the Main Dog Lake Chute had multiple Natural Dry Loose Avalanches that appeared to be initiating from  the steep North facing cliff bands and these also ran to the transitions. Hand Shears and Tilt Tests confirmed the obvious weakness that only got deeper as the day progressed. Snow fall rates were sustained in the S3 to S4 range for the most of the entire day with HN from 0900 exceeding 6 inches, and the HST 14 inches. Snow was extremely light density and there was good bonding to the old snow/new snow interface as the storm came in Rightside up. Still experiencing isolated collapsing, but as visibility was poor most of the day it was difficult to see any other Avalanche Activity. \n",

          "Comments 1": "Went up with intentions of skiing into upper Cardiff via LSB on the East face. East had a crust so noticing all the snow on south facing was good on the way up, decided to ski south face Little Superior out. Did a ski cut from a high to a lower point just off the ridge. Wind slab released that was much bigger than expected. Produced a decent powder cloud on the way down, running approximately 2000 vertical feet. It funneled down through a choke of what I think is called the Two Trees area. I went down skiers left of the slide where snow was not wind effected and ended up skiing through a sizable amount of debris. Would have been a crappy ride if caught in it as lots of rocks now are just under new snow. Definitely enough snow to burry someone. \nGood example of cross loading. West winds loaded snow east of the ridge (see photo of before the slide) straight in front of my ski tips. Everything between my skis and the ridge cracked out. Sorry...no photos of the slide. Would have been difficult to see anyway. ",

I then skied the headwall about 1/3 down and stopped skiers right on a sub-ridge dividing two of the lines. Skiers 2 and 3 skied from the top to me then proceeded to continue down to safety towards the bottom.  Prior to skier 3 leaving me we talked that I would go right into the next line. This is my bad choice letting skier 3 leave before I headed into the other line because I became a solo skier at this point not visible to my party. I did a ski cut at the top without any release.  3 turns in I was part of nature and sliding on my side head uphill with snow rushing around me and behind me. I hit rocks with my skies then bounced off one with my hip. I did yell hoping my party could here me but to no avail. I came to a stop about 150 ft down from the initiation point on the bed surface, and watched the toe of the slide proceed another 460 feet below. I was able to stand right up, didn't lose anything, and ski down the soft avalanche debris to my group, on my one good ski, around the cliffs and regroup. Broke a ski, bruised a hip, and am lucky.\n\n \n\nSoft slab that broke at my feet but knocked me down in the process.  Couldn't tell you how deep. About 35 feet wide and ran about 600 total feet. \n\n \n\nI wasn't going to post anything but here it is. I don't regret where I skied or the slide but I do regret skiing where my partners couldn't watch out for me. If I had been buried they would have had no idea an buy the time they figured it out it likely would have been to late.\n\n \n\nPlease make better choices than I did.\n",

          "Comments 1": "Thanks Bill, Lee and Ron for the heads up on this large avalanche cycle so I could get some photos from across the valley today. I may not have spotted them otherwise. \n \n\nPhotos below show a widespread natural avalanche cycle that occurred on the east side of Chilly Peak, the Chilly Peak slabs, and Zero G Chute. I did my best to try and outline the most prominent crowns and debris toes.  But there are too many to show them all. It appears some ran earlier in the storm, as they appear to be covered with new snow. Zero G appears to have ran late in the cycle as the debris looks crisper and fresher. I'm guessing that the slides ran on the new/old Snow interface. But it's possible it ran with the density inversion combined with high PI rates.  Looks like Zero G ran about 1800 to 2000 foot vertical, likely not stopping not too far above the groomed cross country trails. \n",

          "Comments 1": "\n\nI will start off by saying this has taken me a week to write. I wasn't sure what to say or even if I should share this with anyone. After thinking that this could be a valuable learning experience for someone, I decided to submit my avalanche report, so here goes...\n\n \n\nStairs Gulch. We all know the danger that exists there, yet we still go play there.\n\n \n\nOn May 9, 2023 I headed up Big Cottonwood Canyon and parked across from the Storm Mountain Amphitheater. The big slide that happened in Stairs Gulch on May 3, I had to go see it. I grabbed my pack and I started recording my route on Gaia GPS at 5:36 pm and made the short walk up the trail, reaching the slide path in minutes. It was huge. I snapped a few photos and decided I wanted to see more, so I strapped my snowshoes on and started to venture up the avalanche path.\n\n \n\nNow, before I go any further, I was well aware of what I was doing. I accepted the risk as soon as I made the choice to put those snowshoes on and start walking up that avalanche path. I consider myself to be very experienced with all the time I have spent in these mountains over the years, mostly as solo hiker, peakbagger and snowshoer. When it comes to avalanches, I know a little but still have a lot to learn. I have never put myself purposely in avalanche danger, until May 9, 2023.\n\n \n\nThat big slide from May 3 really made a mess in that gulch as I rounded the first bend. Huge blocks of snow everywhere with big trenches from different sized slides recently. Snow had piled up where slides had stopped. 20 feet maybe more. I dunno. The left side of the gulch had big snow walls that were taller than me and an extended hiking pole. You could also hear water underneath all that snow. It did not seem like the ideal side to be traveling on so I stuck to the right side. It seemed like easier travel. And why is that? The recent avalanches had created a smooth path to walk on. The angle increased significantly going up the slide around the first bend approaching the second bend, slowing me down. This area as you know, is also one of the shortest wall-to-wall widths in the bottom of the gulch. This area was filled with giant round balls of snow everywhere, making for slow going up this portion. I had contemplated just scrambling up the smalls cliffs on the left side at the second bend, but decided to keep on going around the bend. By this time, it was approaching 6:30 pm. I still had sufficient daylight remaining. However, rounding this bend, the terrain got harder to travel on. There was chunks of snow everywhere and was clear this portion of the gulch had been battered with avalanches as it had ran up both sides of the wall at least 10 feet. I chose to continue up the right side as the left side looked like it needed some crampons to walk up. I reached another old dirty slide path coming off the cliffs to the south. At this point the gulch has started to widen and the angle eases a great deal. I have now reached what is likely the widest portion of Stairs at around 6600 ft. It was now 6:30 pm. I left the right side of the gulch and made my way to the very center of this huge avalanche. It was now 6:39 pm as I was snapping photos and taking videos. It really was amazing to see all this debris everywhere you looked. 6:48 pm I thought about venturing on up further to the next bend in the gulch and the elevation climb of 1000+ ft. from that point, and the time, deterred me from it. I was at 6700 feet now and it was 6:53 pm. I am still taking photos and looking straight up the gulch towards that west facing wall. I'm smiling and having an alright time, not knowing I would be running for my life in the next 5 minutes. I take another photo at 7:00 pm...\n\n \n\nLittle did I know what I had just taken a photo of. Uh oh. There was a BIG glide avalanche that had broken loose on that west facing wall. We all know that spot that slides every spring, except I did not know it (until now). I didn't hear it at all. I caught a wall of moving snow out of the corner of my eye. I don't know how wide or tall it was. It looked easily twice as tall as I am. I just knew it was coming and I was still in the middle of that avalanche path where I had been snapping photos for 10 minutes. I ran, with snowshoes on, over avalanche debris. I had a choice to make and only seconds to make it. Left or right. I didn't know what way the slide was going. I saw some trees and dry ground and no snow on the left side. I don't know how I made it there, but I did. Had I chose the right, I would have been in the path of this slide.\n\n \n\nIt all happened so fast as I suppose most avalanches do. I think I was in shock from what just happened to me. I had a glide avalanche in Stairs Gulch after a record snowpack year heading straight towards me, and I didn't get buried. I didn't know what to do. That is when I realized that I had made it to safety and at the same time got myself severely tangled in some twisted up tree limbs. I still had my snowshoes on. I could not get free. It was quite the fight to get myself out of those trees that had been twisted by avalanches. I had literally ran into them with those snowshoes almost breaking my left leg. I don't know how I got myself out. And it wasn't even 7:05 yet. This had all happened in a matter of a few minutes. I turned around to catch the end of the avalanche going by. After all this time, it still made very little sound and only sounded like slush sliding by. I had managed to get those snowshoes off and finally out of those trees. I turned and snapped a quick photo at 7:09 pm of the last bit of snow sliding by. I am freaked out now. I sat on a fallen pine tree trying to gather myself. My ribs hurt, my lower body hurt, especially my left leg and knee. Now what do I do? I always carry a PLB with me. Do I call for help and risk putting someone else in danger an hour before sunset? I didn't want to do that. Finally at 7:24 pm, I put those snowshoes back on and took my chances. If I could make it past that second bend and to the first bend, I can make it. Or so I hoped. I took the chance of there not being two glide avalanches happen in the same place at the same time on the same day. I made my way down so slowly and this time I stayed to the (what is now right) opposite side of the gulch that the slide ran down. It was not fun.\n\n \n\nAt 7:57 I had reached the first bend and knew that I had made it. I don't know how, but I made it. I was so, so incredibly lucky on this day. If the state of Utah had a lottery, I'd have stopped and bought a ticket on the way home. I feel like I should not have returned to the car that night, instead being buried under who knows how much snow. Or have taken a ride directly into some cliffs and suffered some serious trauma. That avalanche broke around 9600 feet (I think) and made it down past the second bend and halfway down to the first bend. I don't know the estimates of the size. You can judge the width and length by the photos that I've included.\n\n \n\nSo, what did I learn from this incident? Well, for one, stay out of Stairs Gulch until those avalanches up high finish releasing. I was very fortunate to have only walked away with a swollen knee, massive bruises on my lower legs and a bruised lower rib. None of those are from the avalanche itself and only from me escaping into those trees.\n\n \n\nI am not a good writer and I apologize for my long novel. I imagine this is the longest avalanche observation ever. This took a lot of time for me to type out. Some of it probably makes little to no sense with my explanations. I happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. Had I started earlier, I likely would have continued on higher up, possibly ending up right where the slide broke. Had I started a little later, I may have been approaching that second bend as that slide was coming down it. All my photo stops, and when I started to slow going up that second bend, causing me to takes breaks, is what I believe could have saved me from getting there at the same time when the slide was coming down. Who knows.\n\n \n\nMy only hope in all this is that someone out there reads my story and gains a little knowledge from it.\n\n \n\n\nPhoto 1: Taken at 6:53 pm where I stopped to take photos in the middle of the slide path. Notice the snow is still dirty.\n\n \n\nPhoto 2: Taken at 7:00 pm. You can see see the slide had broken and was on the way towards me. I had no clue at the time.\n\n \n\nPhoto 3: Zoom shot showing the slide. I didn't see that in the photo until the next day.\n\n \n\nPhoto 4: This was where the slide caught my eye coming down towards me.\n\n \n\nPhoto 5: This was at 7:09 pm and was the only photo I got of the slide, which just shows snow.\n\n \n\nPhoto 6-9: Highlighting the beginning and showing the slide path towards the second bend. Notice the areas with white snow.\n\n \n\nPhoto 10-11: Showing time stamps at 6:53 moments before and then 7:00 of the slide breaking.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd to beat it all, I had my GoPro turned on, but not recording, and strapped to my head that entire time. That would have been great footage...\n\n \n\nThank you and stay safe out there.\n\n\n",

          "Comments 1": "Started at the white pine trailhead bright and early at 4:20 a.m. We evaluated the snow on the way up the north side of Red Baldy. Felt fine for the most part, some very minor slabbing on the top surface at the upper ridgeline. Winds up top had started to come by the time we summited, but were still blowing 10g25 W. One of the party had skied steeper South faces the evening before in upper lcc and noted surprisingly good stability, especially right after fresh snowfall and wind, so we were quite surprised by the outcome on this tour. \n\n \n\nOne of us dropped in with an intentional ski cut, to the right, didn't get anything to move, but did not wait and immediately made another ski turn to the left. About 1 to 2 seconds after initiating the left turn, the slab broke. Luckily they were within a couple feet of the edge and were able to cut above it. We were expecting some wind pockets here and there perhaps, but nothing of this width.\n\n \n\nWe skied down over the bed surface of the debris which was still relatively soft and then stuck to the center of the line as that had previously slid and then gotten covered by another layer of fresh snow. Definitely was tempting to slash the deeper powder on the sidewalls, but we were spooked enough and didn't want to risk triggering anything else. There was a lot more wind loading in there then we expected based on experiences from the afternoon prior.\n\n \n\nPhenomenal skiing despite the slide, however, I won't be trusting any steep South aspects away from the usual bombed highway lines, like I normally do. Seems like there's a crust/surface facet interface that we don't typically have and which is already being reported. We should have been more vigilant here on this tour.\n",

          "Comments 1": "We (a party of 5) started up in the morning headed up the west side of Box Elder from the Dry Creek trailhead with the intend of skiing southwest off of the summit and then down through mellow WNW facing aspens. I've done this tour that last 3 or 4 years on New Years day as it is generally safe and has an old road to by pass the scrub oak even in low snow years. However, since we knew of a party skiing the same route yesterday, rather than taking our normal route up, we instead opted to save time following their skin track one ridge further north.\n\nOnce we reached 8000', we were already experiencing quite and bit of wind out of the East and we decided that a summit descent wasn't going to happen and that we'd just go to timberline and ski down through the aspens. The track we followed also was definitely not better than the normal route, so we were moving more slowly than expected. Between us and our descent of choice was a fairly open, slightly brushed WSW slope that yesterday's skin track crossed. Open seeing the slope, I noticed that a gully was being cross loaded and about a hundred feet below the skin track a small (2-4\" by 10') pocket had pulled out. The skin track crossed the gully higher and was safe (there was a smaller 1\" deep pocket above a flat that cracked when I hit it with a pole). We spread out and continued, wary but not too concerned. I had briefly considered putting in a new track up to the ridge to avoid crossing the slope, but didn't say anything (wanting to get out of the wind quickly) and continued across.\n\nA few hundred yards latter, I spotted a couple of obvious pillows. The left was 30' wide by 20' tall, and the right was 40' wide by 20' tall. The track went below the left one with plenty of breathing room both towards the toe of the right pocket. When I tested it with a ski tip, the perimeter of the pocket cracked all the way around but did not slide. Their appeared to be 2\"-10\" deep pencil-hard windslab. On the other side was sheltered, low angle terrain. I stopped and waited for another member of our party to decide what to do, not wanting to cross the pocket that had cracked. We agreed that it would probably be okay to carefully skin between the left and right pockets and then cross over the top of the right-hand pocket were it had cracked out. I started up but by this time the other members of the group had nearly caught up with us and we didn't realize that they had just moved below the left hand pocket.\n\nAfter a couple of narrowly spaced kick turns, the slope above me and the left-hand pocket all slide. Where I was, the slap was only 3-4\" thick and I stayed put (although it packed some punch and I was not certain I was going to stay were I was). The partner I had consulted with was directly below me and also managed to arrest before going anywhere. The pocket to our left, however, turned out to be tucked in under a small rock, allowing the slab to be 2' deep at that point (much to our surprise). The large slab went directly towards the other three members of our party. One managed to get out of the way, another was carried a few feet, but the third was hit directly and carried about 40'. He managed to grab a 3\" aspen which promptly broke off in his hand but slowed him enough for the slide to go by. At the same time, I was able to quickly kick turn and move into the bed surface to maintain visual contact.\n\nAt this point everyone was okay, but the wind was still blowing hard. Three of us retreated to slightly safer ground while another went down to help search for a missing ski. After ten minutes of searching we found nothing and didn't feel comfortable lingering so we retreated minus one ski. One think we noted afterwards was the chaos associated with the slide. While I was ready to dive down and start digging if necessary, the un-caught member of our group didn't know that anyone had taken ride - we would have been wise to take 30 seconds to communicate before taking any action.\n\n \n",

          "Comments 1": "In an attempt to decrease my risk on my last run I skied skiers left of Sound of Music.  I had been skiing big lines all day however they were mostly on snow pack that gets hit by Canyons traffic.  Recently I have been skiing skiers left of Sound of Music because most ski the big open line of Sound of Music which seems to always have tracks now.  So this line rarely gets skied.  The slide occurred about 2 turns off the ridgeline.  When it broke loose I was pretty sure the staunch wall was right in front of me as I saw a wave of snow in front of me but after I passed the stanch wall the lower snow below must have broken loose as well because that was only the beginning.  Luckily the layer below the new snow was a hard slab that did not move.  After riding over 200 feet and almost hooking a small Aspen at the very top (which in hind sight maybe I should have tried to grab) I finally stopped face up.  Although I was fully covered with debris I was able to use my hand to continually keep the snow out of my mouth.  The snow was soft enough I was able to dig myself out. I had to drop a pole at the last moment to protect my mouth and try to keep snow free around my upper body but with only one swath with my shoever I hit my poll.  As usual I always keep trees in mind and luckily I was aware of the trees up top and chose to stay left of the aspens. Afterwards I skinned up to check out the weak layer.  Thesnow failed on top a thin hard slab about 3 inches thick which layed above a melt freeze layer.",

          "Comments 1": "I was observed this slide and was not involved.  I was transitioning at the bottom of a run through the Lake Martha trees when I noticed a skier and snowboarder making a hasty exit from the northeast slopes of Tuscarora, headed toward the Millicent side of Lake Mary.  Retracing their descent I noticed they had come from the prominent northeast facing chute on Tuscarora, and had triggered a sizeable slide partway down it.  \n\nIt was difficult to get a great view because of the cloud cover, but the slide appeared to start about halfway down the chute as one of the riders was either putting in a ski cut or simply cutting hard to the left into an island of safety about 1/3 of the way down.  From my vantage it looked like either a wind or storm slab, as the bed surface appeared to be dusty.  The debris fan was roughly 200-250 yards wide, and it appears the slide ran roughly 1000 vertical feet.  \n\nI'm not sure if either rider was carried, as they both were making it out with all of their equipment and verbally confirmed they were unhurt, but it was not a spot I would have wanted to go for a ride.  \n\nYes it is the end of April, but there is a lot of new snow above 9000 feet.  Treat it with the respect it would garner mid season.",

The deepest part of the crown was 18 to 20 inches deep. The wind had loaded the slope and it looked like the weak layer was either the small amount of light density that fell on Monday or yesterday's storm snow, then it immediately stepped down to the old hard bed surface, I could still get the hangfire to crack out when I was looking at it.\n",

After seeing a small sluff hit the road the powder cloud engulfed a silver 4Runner that was traveling up canyon. The impact of the slide was sufficient to move the vehicle into the snow bank. All passengers in the vehicle were able to get themselves out of the vehcile with no injuries. Fortunately, the down hill traffic was primiarly comprised of backcountry skiers, so we were able to quickly dig the vehicle out and clear one lane of traffic. \n\n \n\nA few comments. The passengers in the vehicle immediately got out of the car and sat on top of it to pose for pictures as we began to dig. Once someone from UDOT showed up with extra shovels various people started digging without a beacon. Others were wearing beacons but had turned them off as they had finished their tour and were on the way home. Our group had to remind people that we were digging because of avalanche activity. If you're already wearing a beacon and you're driving down the canyon on a high or extreme day, just leave your beacon on until you're home. If you don't have a beacon or necessary equipment and others do, maintain a safe distance. \n",

Did not dig down much to see exactly what the layer was that it failed on, but it was a density change in the snow. There were a bunch of weird layers going on that the wind slabs were breaking on. My partner Alex also got the chute to crack halfway across without a slide after I had been down already. This avalanche problem seems to be on all aspects and elevations. Later in the day I was causing little slides and cracking on test slopes closer down to the LCC road on the south facing slopes. ",

We observed some minor red flags on the way up such as a bit of cracking under our skis on steeper slopes and a small whumpf on the skintrack. Overall though it seemed like the new snow had settled out and we did not see a lot of evidence of wind effect except for one section of the skintrack around 9000' that was completely covered over. On the way up the steep headwall and on the traverse from the summit over to greaseball we kicked at some test slopes and got minor cracking, but nothing that propagated and no slabs.\n\n \n\nRegardless we figured it would be wise to do a ski cut before dropping in. We started down on a small ridge just skier's left of greaseball proper. My partner did a ski cut and got no result. He skied down to a rollover that dropped skier's right into greaseball and did one more cut. A 6\" slab released and propagated across the chute. As the slide traveled down it pulled out some deeper pockets about 10-12\" deep or so.\n\n \n\nIn total, the slide ran 1600' down the gully, right about to the point where the skintrack crossed it. The debris did not pile up that deeply in any one spot but fanned up out of the gully a little bit at the end. \n",

          "Comments 1": "Area traveled began around 7k and went up to 8400 feet; Upon approaching  8100 feet snow stratigraphy and avalanche hazard changed drastically.  Shooting cracks occurred on slopes of about 25 degrees; At 8400 feet I  was traversing vertically across the slope on a NNW facing slope, and I  was actually on a flat bench when I remotely triggered Chute number 7 in  the Argenta chutes. It broke 7 feet below the bench I was traveling on.  Collapse failure occurred from collapsing on the bench with shooting  cracks extending below me, the slope directly below me was no greater  than 25 degrees with a roll over 80 feet down hill. Catastrophic Failure  appeared to occur as a result of a failure in  compression because of  the slope being tied into the 35 to 38 degree rollover directly down  hill. Cracks shot out to riders left to where the slope ties into a  contour shoulder/nose that has a 35 to 38 degree side hill aspect facing  NE. Width at the starting zone was approximately 80 feet. Slope  checker-boarded below me and took off. Soft slab, yet in the low angel  starting zone it left soft chunks scattered about. Weak layer was  obviously surface hoar. No need for a hand lense here. The slope had a  shimmer and served as a great slippery bed surface. Upon observing slope  upon descent when heading back down ascending route it obviously  continued down hill propagating at each opening of the gully area. Slope  ran 1300 vertical, full course, It remained contained in the gully  without propagating to adjacent slopes. At it's widest apex it was about  120 feet wide. Crown face was between 12 and 14 inches. Slope did not  gouge in to older snow. Ran to with in 20 feet of the creek, 1350  vertical. Debris at the toe was minimal...2 to 2.5 feet deep. ",

          "Comments 1": "Discovered this large avalanche in West Monitor Bowl while hiking out of South Monitor, looks to have occurred in the early morning hours seeing that the bed surface had 3 inches of light density snow on it. Not really sure if soft slab is a good definition because the slab at the bottom was a one finger hard slab. The crown was on a 32 to 33 degree slope which roles over and gets steeper down lower on the slope. The crown averaged around 2ft but was 3ft in the middle. It measured between 450 to 500ft taking all the snow out to the ground. I did a crown profile which revealed light density snow on top with the slab getting stiffer moving down through the pack. It failed on facets on the October crust then stepped down to the facets below the crust at the ground interface, taking the crust with it. I’m positive that this slope has already avalanched once if not twice already this season.\nPhotos: crown and flanks of the avalanche, crown profile, and the runout, and a video showing the whole deal",

          "Comments 4": "Forecaster Comment: Below here we are copying and pasting in the words of UDOT forecaster John Woodruff. \" Here is a quick write up of what we are seeing in the Provo area mtns. Last weeks rapid warm up in temps had kicked the free flowing water into high gear for the start of the spring run off even at the upper elevations on everything but the upper N1/2 of the compass. Low elevation snow that still remains has gone isothermal, and the mid elevation snow is gradually moving that direction. Upper elevation snow is still a mix of damp round DH, crusts, fine grain damp rounds, large wet rounds, and slush.\n\nProblem #1 - This is the trickiest and easiest to overlook, but the persistent slab problem from the week layer that sits anywhere from 4cm to 20cm below the the Feb 18th dirt layer is still reactive. Pit tests on Cascade and Timp have both confirmed this with Compression tests yielding results ranging from CT23SP, CT25SP, to CT23SC in the past 2-8 days. This week layer is slowly turning into a deep slab problem as it joins the large wet rounding DH sitting on the bottom 20cm-35cm of the snow pack. All of this water percolating down is going to make these full depth releases a greater possibility. \n\nProblem #2 - Wet Slab activity will be increasing as this water pools above MF and rain crusts still intact with in the snow pack. Attached is a picture of a pit at 9900', ESE, 41deg slope on the east side of Timp. HS-90cm with wet saturated snow down to 76cm and water percolating through damp fine grained rounds and ponding just above the crust at 50cm in the snow. (The dirt layer sits at 33cm for reference). Until the water develops some reliable runnels and escapes through the rain/MF crusts these will form nice bed surfaces for these wet avalanches to start, and then step down to the ground once their weight overwhelms the weak damp basil layers. \n\nProblem #3 - Wind slabs (most likely to encounter). We have noted isolated wind slabs at mid elevations to large widespread uniform wind slabs at upper elevations that formed on the 27th-28th of Feb. They are gaining strength, however you can still pry them out. \n\nWe noted 4 separate avalanches on the upper elevations of Timp yesterday (April 1). All were on NE faces around 11000'. All 4 avalanches likely occurred on Wed the 28th from strong SW winds transporting snow onto the NE faces. We observed isolated wind slab formations in Primrose Cirque on the 28th that were easily triggered by a skier. \n\nThe first was on the Emerald Lake Headwall (Timp Glacier) a HS-NC-R2D3-O. 800' wide by 3'-5' deep. 11200' down to 10600' (600' vertical foot fall). \n\nSecond was below the summit shack on the NE face. HS-NC-R1D2 (wind slab). 60' wide by 2' deep. 11200' down to 10400' (800' vertical foot fall. Mostly due to steepness of area)\n\nThird was off the Timp Basin Ridge just north of the summer trail. HS-NC-R2D3-O. 500' wide by 6'-9' deep. 11000' down to 10800' (300' vertical foot fall) \n\nFourth was the largest. Thanks to the pictures from Turly we were able to determine that the entire slope to the north of the natural ax that he photographed including wrapping into Stairmaster bowl had avalanched. 11200' down to possibly 8500' (2700' vertical foot fall with a substantial debris pile) \n\nThe snow pack in the Hidden Lake Basin is around 145cm-270cm deep with the Feb 18th dirt layer at 70cm. Most of the snow depth in the Southern Wasatch has come after Feb 18th which means that we have a still reactive buried weak layer sitting on top of large moist just barely starting to round DH with a lot of very dense damp snow capping all of that. My personal take away point for all of this is that while this deep dense snow is capping the weak layers if you do manage to trigger something on the NE-NW upper elevations of the Southern Wasatch it will be big, deep, and not good. I suspect that these rapid warmups will increase the likely hood of pulling one of these slides out by tipping the stress on the snow pack close to the breaking point. There is still A LOT of the upper north side of the Timp Massif that has not avalanched yet.\"",

          "Comments 1": "One the way down the canyon this afternoon we noticed a recent large slide in the canyon right behind the old Zanavoo Restaurant.  The slide started on a steep north facing slope around 7600 feet and traveled 2400 vertical feet down to 5200 feet.  There was no fresh snow on the debris pile so it likely happened yesterday or today before 2:00.  It was a pretty impressive slide gouging down to dirt and mud and leaving a significant pile 10-15 feet deep.\n\nWe noticed other recent activity while we were out today but not nearly what we expected after seeing the large destructive avalanches in virtually every canyon on the Wellsvilles.  Below is a list of other slides that we saw today:\n\nThurston Hollow:  We saw a large avalanche, approximately 1/3 mile wide at the crown. At the head of Thurston Hollow (a south fork of Hyde Park Canyon).  The crown encompassed most of the bowl on slopes facing WSW through NW at 8400 feet elevation.  We could not see the runout zone but the width of the crown was impressive. \n\nSteammill Peak:  A 100 wide foot pocket release mid slope on an east facing slope between Steam mill 2nd and 3rd Peak.  The pocket was at 8900 feet elevation.\n\nState Line Bowl:  It looked like the Southern end of the bowl slid during the storm.  The slide was on an East facing slope around 8800 feet elevation\n\nTab Hollow:  A 400 foot wide avalanche was also notice on a northeast facing slope in Tab Hollow.  The crown was mid slope at an elevation of 8200 feet.  We could not see how far the slide ran\n\n \n\nWe found surprisingly stable conditions where we rode today.  We stayed on mostly east facing slopes between 8600 and 6500 feet.  We did not notice any collapsing or cracking of any kind.  There is a significant layer of rime on the ridgelines and surface hoar is grow in many areas.  We tested several steeper slopes by dropping 15-20 foot cliffs onto the slopes with no results.\n",

Luckily he triggered it right on the flank and was not in danger of burial. The debris pile was at least 20ft deep, my probe would not reach the ground fully extended. The slide looked to have taken out the snow from our last two little storms and the bigger storm from yesterday, sliding on the hard crust from the warm spell before that. The boarder was about a quarter of the way down the slope when he triggered it and it fractured across and up-slope of the trigger point. Luckily he wasn't in the gut of it or it most likely would have had not ended well.\n\nMike Dawson:\n\nThree separate parties arrived at the top of West Monitor in quick succession. My party of two skiers descended first, without incident or any signs of instability. Shortly thereafter, while my party was ascending the skin track at the north end of the bowl, the second party of two also skied the bowl without incident. While the second party was at the base of the bowl, a solo snowboarder, the fifth rider to enter, remotely triggered an avalanche. (I gathered the following information from the boarder and the members of the second party). The avalanche started above and to the north of him, when he was approximately 30% through his run. The party below yelled up to alert the boarder, who immediately bee-lined it to the bottom. The avalanche fan caught up to him at the bottom but he stayed upright, having only been partially buried over his boots. The boarder lost his poles, which he dropped to hasten the bee-line, but was happy to be alive and uninjured. The party of two at the base of the bowl during the avalanche were also lucky to have been able to side step the deposition at the toe.\n\nOther Observations. This is a repeater avalanche, the first two times being in late December and mid January. Prior to yesterday’s storm, West Monitor had been heavily tracked. In spite of the wind that accompanied the storm, the new snow had no signs of slabbing or instability. Cornice cuts on the ridge yielded only minor sluffing. The avalanche ran completely in the new snow and did not step down into the old faceted layers. In retrospect, although the the new snow had no visible signs of slabbing from yesterday’s storm, there were red flags: 1. West Monitor is a repeater. No repeater is to be trusted until it’s bed surface is pouring out of your faucet in the Spring; 2. West Willow (another infamous repeater) had slid during the storm or shortly afterwards. We had observed the presence of the Willow slide earlier in the morning; 3. The avalanche advisory reported soft slab avalanche from control work in the same area with similar aspect, angle and elevation (although during the storm); 4. West Monitor had been receiving full sun throughout the morning, and this is a factor later in season (is it really later in the season, already!!!); 5. As I stood at the top of the bowl discussing the health of a buddy who had recently been caught and seriously injured in an avalanche, I had an instinctive twinge of reservation about skiing the bowl. Although me and my partner skied the bowl, ourselves, without incident, we realize now that we were just mighty lucky, as were the second party and the boarder who just happen to draw the short straw. I will be trusting instincts and staying away from repeaters for the remainder of 2018.\n\n[Forecaster Comment - Excellent writeup and retrospection of considering dropping into avalanche terrain. Although this may have been a repeater from earlier in the season, the slide ran on a stout sun crust that formed during the week of February 5. Two small storms (Saturday Feb 10 and Monday Feb 12) fell on top of this crust, followed by the larger storm on Thursday Feb 15. This avalanche took out the storm snow from these three recent storm events, and did not run on weaker faceted layers that would be present in slide paths from repeater avalanches.]\n",

          "Comments 1": "I was expecting fairly poor riding conditions today so I decided it would be fun to get up to a high summit to get a view and maybe get blasted by the wind.  This time of year I enjoy walking up the west ridge of the Birthday Chutes to the summit of Red Top.  If need-be, a relatively safe descent can be made following the ridge and skinner back to the White Pine road.  There are a couple short, steep pitches one has to navigate before you get on the ridge that I thought would be manageable in the current danger.  We broke trail from the road and the shady snow was good.  Higher, we were skinning up the ridge on generally wind-hammered snow when, at the location of the X in the illustration, I had a crack shoot out from my skis.  I could see that the whole slope to my left had spiderwebbed, but not moved.  As we (party of two) were marveling at the collapse, we saw a powder cloud shoot out from the bottom of the westernmost Bday chute.  It had slid wall-to-wall, to the ground, basically removing the entirely of the snowpack from the length of the chute.  No other chutes slid to our knowledge. The collapse must have propagated 150-200 feet to cause this. The debris piles were large, with big chunks of windboard in it.  As usual, the strong SW winds were loading this slope and I suspect this made the danger locally higher.  In the illustration the blue line is our skinner, the red line outlines the collapsed area, and the red hash indicates areas that slid.  A large area that was probably near 30 deg didn't slide.  \n\nOne thing I have been thinking about since the seriously unstable snow last weekend is whether or not one can look at a spiderwebbed slope as being as safe as an avalanched one.  If the fracture has already propagated across it, can you cause an avalanche by then riding it?  My intuition says 99% of the time this is true.  But not 100%.  Is this proof that the slope is not steep enough to slide?  I am guessing that with these slides failing on the ground, the friction of the bed surface is relatively high, and just because the slope didn't totally fail this time, doesn't mean that with a smooth suncrust as a bed surface it might not slide then.  We took the most conservative route down to avoid testing these questions.  Even though we had no intention to ski the Bday chutes, it was still a good scare at the beginning of the season to keep one honest.  The phone was dying so we didn't get but one poor picture that I didn't attach.  Flat light made visibility difficult anyway.",

After ensuring the path was clear of people, my partner approached the cornice and when he was about 10 feet from it, it remotely triggered the slide. It propagated around the corner from SE aspect to the due S aspect. Rapid wind transport was the main problem on this slope and due to this, I would not recommend traveling past the pass on guardsman road due to the chance of remotely triggering one of the steep slide paths that overhangs the road.",

Southerly aspects began shedding first as usual even at the upper reaches of the mid elevations. From 8500 down, even the northerly aspects were shedding from 1330 on. By the end of the day this cycle had included all aspects from at least 9000 feet down. The lower elevations were extremely dangerous in the afternoon hours even on the northerly aspects. \n\n \n\nAlso of note, many large and deadly roof avalanches began shedding on the 24th, but the largest and most dangerous roof avalanches had yet to shed by the end of the day on the 25th. With the Rapid Warming and unseasonably high temperatures forecast for Monday the 26th, the remainder of these roof avalanches will Likely be reactive and producing life threatening slides that have at least up to 30 cm of solid hard ice in their structure. \n",

Could have been last night once it quit snowing or this morning when the cornice heated up. Trigger was a large natural cornice drop, dug down into the rock slab at first then released a 20ft wide pocket with a crown 2 to 3ft deep, probably the last two storms worth of snow. When it ran it entrained quite a bit of snow with the debris pile fanning out to about 100ft at the toe of the slide. Ran about 1000 vertical ft before it came to a stop on lower angled terrain. Not a slide you would want to be caught in. Curious about when it slid since it seemed quite fresh, thinking it might have run today with the warm temps heating the cornice enough to make it calve off. Was not in the area until 2:00pm Powder Birds might have a better idea on the timing since they were in that area long before me.",

It's a pretty impressive slide for the area, and it hammers  home the lesson about the depth hoar lurking on these mid-elevation  spots that are normally safe. The only thing I'd add to the report the  guy sent in is that there was also extensive wind-loading in the area,  which is pretty normal for this aspect. The slide is actually on the  side of SP that rarely gets gets skied because it gets hammered by the  winds.  ",

Here are some photos and a quick summary. I will edit a more complete video and add additional information and a snow profile as time allows. Bruce Tremper\n\"Whisky Hill\" is a steep, popular hill climbing area on the eastern flanks of the Monte Cristo snowmobiling complex between Huntsville and Woodrruff Utah. The paved summer road between Huntsville and Woodruff passes near Whisky Hill but the road is not plowed in winter, making it a popular snowmobiling area. To get from the road to the bottom of Whisky Hill, most people have to descend one of two narrow, steep-sided ravines, one on the north side or one on the south side. \nA group of very experienced and well-avalanche-trained snowmobilers decided to descend the ravine on the south side of Whisky Hill. They were the first group to descend this gully since the last storm. They were spread out and the lead snowmobiler triggered a large, hard slab avalanche as he descended in the bottom of the ravine. He triggered it from the bottom and it fractured out the entire slope above him, which broke out in a hard slab 4' deep and about 400 feet across. The crown face (upper fracture) of the avalanche was about 250-300 vertical feet above the bottom of the ravine (and the victim).\nThe snowmobiler who triggered the avalanche noticed the slope buckle and he gunned his snowmobile in an attempt to escape but the avalanche caught and buried him in the ravine bottom about 4' deep and buried his snowmobile about 10' deep, just a few feet away from him. Both he and the snowmobile were pushed up against trees. The avalanche partially caught the next rider but he was not buried. The rest of the group quickly located the buried snowmobiler with beacons, then quickly struck him with a probe and several people quickly dug him out. It was a textbook rescue, executed flawlessly. They uncovered the victim in about 5 minutes. Luckily, this group regularly practices rescue scenarios and the practice paid off.\nAs a final note, they indicated that there was another group of about 6 snowmobilers following them that planned to descend the same gully. They did not appear to have any rescue gear. So perhaps the group that triggered this avalanche prevented a very tragic accident.\n ",

The slope that avalanched faced southeast, is 35 degrees at the top of the slab and 32 degrees on the lower half of the slope. The slope is only about 300 vertical feet and the avalanche was about 250 vertical feet from the fracture line to the bottom of the ravine and about 300 vertical feet to where the debris stopped as it traveled down the ravine. The slope is un-treed. Above the slope, there is a large, flat fetch, which is near the top elevation of the surrounding terrain, so the wind obviously had deposited a wind slab onto the steep slope. Strong northwest winds over the previous days transportd a lot of snow onto the downwind southeast facing slopes.",

The weak layer was a layer of faceted snow that formed in the first half of January. A period of heavy snowfall occurred during the last couple weeks of January capped off by strong winds from the northwest for the 2-3 days previous to the accident.\nIt's unusual for faceted snow to form on slopes that face the south half of the compass in Utah because at this latitude, the sun usually is warm enough to either prevent the formation of faceted snow or destroy it after it forms. For whatever reason, we have noticed a number of other avalanches on southeast facing slopes with a similar snowpack structure.\nMy snow profiles along the crown face of the avalanche showed Extended Column Tests failing on easy elbow taps and Compress tests failed on easy elbow taps as well (ECTP-11) (CT-11 x3). All failed on the faceted snow layer about 4 feet deep.\nThe avalanche advisory from the Utah Avalanche Center for the Ogden area mountains called for a Considerable Danger (orange, level 3) because of persistent slabs and recent wind drifting.",

Most of the north-facing apron on the north face of Red Baldy had slid, with crowns of 1-2' beneath the rock band. We also noted that the skier's rightmost Tri Chute had slid during the storm. I was unable to get a good picture on my phone, but indicated the location of the slide with red arrows. It appeared, like the Red Baldy slides, to be 1-2' deep and flushing the width of the chute. From reading the observations, it appears the middle Tri Chute was subsequently triggered by a party later in the day.\n",

This was a natural avalanche that appeared to have started as wet-loose rollerballs and stepped down to create a wet slab avalanche on a southeast facing aspect of the gully. The slide was approximately. 100-150' wide and ran 1200' vertical.  Probing in the bed surface there was still 170-190cm of snow left below the debris. This wet slab avalanche gouged out a significant chunk of the upper level snowpack and pulled to the ground in steep cliffy areas.  It did not run full path and started approximately halfway down the slide path. \n\n \n\nPhoto of the crown\n",

I dropped my first turn into the Cirque today into and everything I was standing on fell apart and started moving. The snow was just over a ski-width wide that I had dropped into. Maybe a little bold of a line, but that is a different story. Wet, heavy, and dragging would be the best words I could use for it. Luckily rolled out before the exposure, but shook me enough to send me home with my tail between my legs. Had all my gear, but am not certain the guy that was nearest had anything. I have noticed a lot of people without gear skiing the BC of Snowbird this weekend.

We decided to dig a pit just above the cracks on lower angle terrain to look for that weakness. \n",

          "Comments 1": "My little brothers were snowmobiling in American Fork Canyon when they came across a buried snow machine. They found it with just the ski poking up out of the snow. They stopped and dug around, believing that a person was probably buried as well. They did not have any avy gear (don't get me started on that...) but were able uncover much of the sled. My guess is that the slide was triggered from the sled crossing under the steep bank that was loaded with new snow. It broke out above the sled and came down on top. This all happened right on the road, at a spot with a steep, barren slope above the cut of the road. I've seen small rock slides in this spot during the summer. (A satellite view of the map above shows how abrupt the slope is) They called the police, and using the license information on the sled the police were able to contact the owner, who abandoned the sled after it was buried. Other than that, I have no other details. The incident served as a wake up call for my brothers. They understand now that any steep slope, regardless of the proximity of the nearest road, can be deadly. Luckily, it appears that nobody was hurt.",

          "Comments 1": "We observed a crown from a natural slide at the N/NE ridge of lower Beaver Envy from the Garden City approach. It appeared to be a wind slab on the ridge that ran down to the treeline 30-40 feet below. It may be natural or a remote trigger from the Swan Flats or in the  - there was no sign of skier or sled activity from our distant vantage. It appeared to have gone after Monday's storm snow loaded up on a wind slab/cornice. Another member of my party has pictures of this slide.      (photo from Brian Green)\n\nOnce at Garden City, extended column tests failed between 10 and 15 taps on 35 degree slops. The rain crust failed all three times. Fast powder for riding, but the potential for hidden dragons on rollovers and steeper north-facing terrain is very real.",

When I looked back up at my run I saw I had pulled out a pocket that had run over half of my tracks and left a debris pile about 2.5 feet deep stopping on the 20 degree apron, it was shallow enough my tracks that cut deeper could still be seen in the slide path.  My partners skied down the more protected tree line and informed me it had broke about three seconds after I passed the fracture line and moved rather slowly never threatening to over run me.  From  observing smaller sluffs it seemed a light crust had formed yesterday afternoon and the new snow about 4\" deep came down on top of it over night forming a very soft slab that was running on that surface.  Just before starting the run the sun came out for a very short time and a lot of point release sluffs occurred.  we climbed our uptrack one more time and skied some lower angle near by, one of my partners set off another small sluff that was not observed until we were back at the lake. Deciding we were pushing our luck we called it a day.",

          "Comments 1": "Saw a few massive debris piles at the bottom of various slide paths on Timpanogos.   1) At the bottom of an hour-glass shaped chute on the south-western end of Timp, a slide ran far and wide down into the mountain bike trails in the area. Observed the path from Highway 189.  2) A large south facing path ran into the scrub oak, leaving a very impressive debris pile. Again, observed this from the car while driving on 189.  3) Another large slide could be seen from the valley on the SW face of Timp, running to Dry Canyon.  4) East side of Elk Point ran, leaving another big pileup not far above the Sundance Nordic trails. Saw the pile while xc skiing. The staff at the yurt said they'd never seen that path run so big.  I suspect all of these ran naturally during the upside down snow last week. These were big slides that ran from way up high and covered the full length of the paths. From some of the other obs and reports, it's pretty clear that Timpanogos was raining avalanches during the event.",

          "Comments 1": "This avalanche broke over 2000 feet wide. It happened naturally sometime Friday evening near the end of the storm. There was just a trace of new snow on the debris. It broke on 1mm facets just under a thick layer of graupel that fell at the onset of the storm. One avalanche professional who has worked in this area for a very long time said that he had only seen this slope produce an avalanche that wide twice in all his years.\n\nI got numerous collapses to occur in the meadows under this slope as I was approaching the debris field which tells us that a similar avalanche could occur tomorrow and the foreseeable future. Facets take a long time to heal and tend to only get weaker this time of year (they rarely get stronger this time of year).\n\nPhoto 1 - only shows 1/4 of the crown line\n\nPhoto 2 - You can see dirt in the graupel that was in the air in the valley when this storm began and was deposited with the graupel. Other avalanches in this area show a similar line in the crowns. It is significant only as a marker. Just below the graupel, I drew a line in the facets on which this avalanche fractured.\n\nPhoto 3 - Dark line roughly shows the crown except it broke higher right next to the rocks above the line\n",

This came off of a northern aspect near \"Rabbit Head\" for those familiar with signs on the road, and while there were plenty of trees and I couldn't visualize the top of the slide, the slope angle near the road was in the neighborhood of 35°. Avalanche debris was 6 to 8 feet deep across the road, which is not plowed in the winter but is frequented by snow cats, snowmobile's, UTVs with tracks, etc. Several passes had already been made over the top of the debris pile. The photo is taken from above and doesn't do justice to the depth of the debris. Given how dense the trees were and the nature of the terrain, I highly doubt this was human triggered as people typically don't ski that terrain and that low in the canyon. There was approximately 5 inches of new snow on top of the debris pile, suggesting this likely happened a couple of days ago . \n",

Looks like the entire bowl, except perhaps the small subridge between the two sides of the bowl, slid to the ground in the early part of the storm, perhaps as early as Friday night or Saturday morning as a fair amount of new snow had built back in.  Then the center of the bowl looked to natural again, new snow only, later in the storm, perhaps Saturday night or Sunday. So portions of the bowl have about 2.5 feet of new snow on top of what is left of the old depth hoar, with the portion that slid having about a foot of snow on top of a small amount of depth hoar.  Photos below: 1) the crown along the ridgeline of the most recent new snow slide, 2) the track with debris from the most recent slide in the foreground and rough debris from the deep slide just visible at the bottom, and 3) photo of the snow left on the bed surface with a couple notes.\n",

          "Comments 1": "We skied Maybird Couloir late in the day yesterday, and hadn't seen the slightest sign of instability. We figured it wouldn't be terribly dissimilar across the canyon, even with the opposite (north-facing) aspect. By 7700 feet or so the snow had turned to ice and as we approach 8000 feet we decided to bail early, not wanting to skid down 1500 feet of ice. It had been snowing reasonably hard as we climbed, but it wasn't layering the ice with anything more than an inch or two. Or so it seemed.\n\n \n\nWe proceeded down with only the most minor of sloughing of the new snow. I skied 50-100 feet below my partner to wait for him. We had radios but wanted to keep within eyesight. We reached a point at roughly 7,500 feet where the snow was soft and fun and as I turned to take a picture of my partner skiing down, a wall of snow hit me and knocked me off my feet. My partner also got nailed (\"a shockingly hard hit\") but was angled in such a way that he absorbed the initial shock and skied to the side. He couldn't believe how much snow kept coming, given that what we were booting up for the last few hundred feet had been ice and we assumed it continued above us.\n\n \n\nAt this point I had been carried by the snow 800-900 feet out of sight. My partner put his beacon in search mode and started down, calling me on the radio. (We always carry radios.) I was trying to self-arrest but had foolishly left my whippets in the car and couldn't get my elbows down into the slope or anything to stop me. Had we been in Y-Not with cliffs, it almost certainly would have been much worse. Fortunately, the river of snow eventually spit me out to the left, maybe at about 6600 feet? My partner met me a minute or two later. All of my gear was intact (ironically, I was still holding the phone I'd pulled out to take a picture). \n\n \n\nIn terms of learnings, we felt like we had managed risk reasonably well, having observed conditions the evening before and as we climbed. THAT SAID, the snow started coming down pretty hard while we were climbing. Our best guess is that it was new snow piling on yesterday's load that triggered the release. We weren't really noticing how fast it was coming down, but that seems like the clearest explanation for where all that snow came from. In the same situation again, we'd turn around when in steep terrain when the snow starts to fall in earnest.\n\n \n\nSorry, no pics. We were both a little busy.\n",

Reported as easy trigger from starting zones, running about half track length, and as being managable with ski cuts and good backcountry practices.\nThe slide I reported on figure 8 hill was also reported to Brighton Patrol by side country users.\nI would like to thank the folks that take time to notify patrol of these incidents. Once again this sharing of information helps out the resort/backcountry community relationship and promotes would be rescuer safety by not exposing rescue teams to hazards without reason.",

A skier from a different party had traversed out to skiers left of the rock and had made a turn when the snow released from the rocks roughly 30 feet above him and carried him about 150-200 ft below. the avalanche continued on another 300-400 ft below him. We were able to keep an eye on him until he stopped and the avalanche continued past him. We checked with him and he was okay- no visible injuries, just shaken up a little. Looking up on the slide from below, we could see that the avalanche had propogated roughly 100 feet or so across the slope to the west, which was nearly all in the scrub pines We observed other much smaller slabs throughout the Baldy shoulder terrain, and the theme seemed to be same- heavier, wind loaded snow sitting on top of a crust and facets, which collapsed fairly easy.\nThis slide occurred while Alta Ski Area was not open yet for the season.",

          "Comments 1": "This was a very interesting avalanche because of how connected the slab was. This slope is concave (like the inside curve of a frying pan) and it looked like the grauple pooled at the transition zone creating a weak layer. How the slab became so connected and cohesive is the million dollar question?\n\nMy theory would be that the Hogum headwall must of seen a sustained period of wind, (15-30 mph) whether that wind blew up canyon or down canyon remains pure speculation, as I was a long ways out from this avalanche. It could of also been because of an intense precipitation spike during the storm as well. However, the avalanche looked fairly recent.  \n\nNot sure if heat or settlement of the new snow had any role in slab formation, as it was still very cold on the north aspects when I noticed this avalanche. This was the only avalanched I observed in my travels today and really the only instability worth mentioning. \n\nI did take a step back and had to realize this was a big avalanche, I was surprised to see such a connected slab. I would put this avalanche in the unmanageable category. I did cautiously continue with my planned tour and had no troubles in any of the steeper north facing aprons. \n\nFORECASTER COMMENTS:  This most likely failed on a layer of graupel that rolled off the steeper slopes and pooled below.  We were finding areas with graupel pooling directly after the storm.  Most areas with pooling were not all that sensitive but it was noted in our travels.  Kobernik\n\nSecond Photo:  Jim Harris\n",

Once the slide hit the valley floor it traveled down the canyon floor for 1800 feet. Its worth a look for the amount of snow. Picture 2 is standing next to bottom end of slide.\n",

          "Comments 1": "Went to check out the slide in Caribou Basin reported on Jan. 21st. The avalanche was 2.5 to 3 feet deep, occurred on a NE slope at 9800' and failed above the thanksgiving rain crust on facets. The slide ran to a natural bench feature at the bottom of the slope and stacked up a sizable debris pile. \n\nThis is a good amount of snow and the rider who triggered the slide appeared to make it off the slab unharmed.  Bottomline... avalanches continue breaking close to the ground, they're unmanageable and can easily ruin your day, end your season... or worse. There is great riding to be found on the south half of the compass where these persistent weak layers aren't hiding.",

The debris indicated that the slide ran  when the surface snow was still damp and or saturated from the overnight  rain and high temperatures. Debris piles had wet slab runnels, piles,  and tunnels from channeling. Debris was at least 5 feet deep and had run  at least 300 feet in length. Starting zones ranged from 42 to 37  degrees with a crown face and flanks of at least 12 inches. Width was  approximately 300 feet. It appeared that the initial weak layer was near  surface facets that were the upper 4 to 6 inches of old snow surface  prior to the new snow and rain that came in on Saturday evening. Of  note: it appeared that once initial failure occurred the slide stepped  down in several areas connected to the steep cliff bands where it was  able to pull out depths of up to and slightly over 2 feet. The weak  layer here was facets below the December Rime crust. This weak layer of  facets was up to at least 2cm of 4 finger snow with harnesses of at  least one finger directly above and containing the Rime Crust. ",

The avalanche picked up momentum and powered through some trees and over some cliffs. \n\n \n\nForecaster note: Much of Days Draw avalanched sometime in late November. We do not have a record of it in our avalanche database, but an avalanche crown(s) were observed in Days Draw on Nov 28th. It likely slid several days before this. UAC staff visited the site on Sunday, December 23. The crown averaged 12-24\", failing on a layer of very weak, early-season facets. There were several tracks throughout Days Draw, including adjacent to the slope that avalanched. Extended column tests on adjacent slopes were ECTX (no fracture), but results were ECTP23 at the crown of the avalanche, likely indicating the rider had just hit the sensitive \"sweet spot\" that could avalanche.

          "Comments 1": "Over the course of this extended and delightfully refreshing storm cycle, we've been skiing mid-elevation and largely wind-protected pockets of Millcreek and Neff's where we have continued to see very low density snow stack up with minimal wind effect on top of a snowpack with very prevalent facets and depth hoar. As we continued to find that snow in these areas hadn't consolidated and had no wind slab forming, we continued to buy into that feedback and sought out similar terrain options. This morning we met the end of that narrative in the form of a close call, sighs of relief, and lessons to be learned.\n\n \n\nWe were on our last lap of the day and had skinned up nearby the spot of the avalanche. As we descended the upper portion of the slope, we continued to get positive feedback (or confirmation bias) that the blower powder hadn't consolidated and was only acting up in the form of loose-snow sloughs when the angle steepened. Both skiers descended partway down the run, then skier 1 cut to the north for a longer fall line. As the skier turned within 20' of a perpendicular rock wall, the slope propagated and fractured along the edge of the cliff 100' down and across the slope, ending at a young pine tree. Skier 1 saw the slide break out, quickly turned away from the moving snow, and was not caught or carried. Skier 2 was not involved in the avalanche. The avalanche ran for 500 feet through dispersed pine trees. \n\n\nThe slope was approximately 35 degrees, northeast facing, and held around 18\" of low density powder. The crown was closer to 2' and slid on a firm crust with a thin layer of facets sitting on top. Underneath the thin crust (2-3cm) the snow was entirely faceted. About 50' below the crown, cracks where the slide had impacted below the crust were visible, but the slide did not step into deeper layers below the bed surface at the starting zone.\n\n\nOne of the realizations we've had is that in the previous six weeks of high pressure, we have witnessed the rapid decay of snow in rocky terrain on shaded aspects, which is precisely where the slab was triggered and propagated across.\n\n \n\nAnother key takeaway is that we're dealing with a very complex landscape currently and Nikki nailed it in her forecast today -- we experienced spatial variability in terrain that seemed very similar to what we had previously traveled and skied, but behaved extremely differently. \n \n\nIn hindsight, we can see how the accumulation of upwards of 16-18\" of snow over the past few days has led to increasingly more slab-like behavior as it has settled and received some degree of wind.\n\n \n\nFeeling the mountains gave us a free hall pass today, but not counting on any more.\n",

          "Comments 1": "At  approx 3 pm Alta Central received a call of a skier involved in an avalanche off the Emma Ridge. A party of two were descending Emma Two, carefully navigating the terrain, when one of the skiers triggered a small wet slide. The skier went for a ride and hit a large chunk of set up debris, pinning his arm, as momentum continued to carry him downhill, resulting in a possible fractured arm. There was  no burial and the injured skier and his partner, were able to ski down without additional assistance.\nThese two skiers were doing everything right by choosing a conservative route. However, spring avalanche conditions can change rapidly with just a little warming, a brief glimpse of sunshine, or a bit of greenhousing, and even a small wet slide in steep terrain can stack up a lot of snow in a hurry. I hope the injured skier recovers quickly from their injuries. ",

I moved quickly down the last section and because of the aspen, I couldn’t help but to ski the steeper face. I stopped at the bottom and looked up at the slide that had occurred and was still moving. It was piling up at the base in a grove of aspen. I was several yards away and protected from being hit. The slide was mostly the new snow from last week (8 inch layer), but where it was piling up was deep enough to bury someone. \n\n",

          "Comments 1": "Observed a couple big naturals in Broads Fork today.  Most notable was what appeared, from a distance, to be a fresh deep slab release on the backside of O'Sullivan Peak, west of Tanners Col, running to the flats beneath E couloir of Twin Peaks.  The closest we got to the crown was the toe of Bonkers, so the dimensions I've provided are estimated.  I'm guessing it ran sometime towards the end of the storm on 2/12 or 2/13, as the debris still looked fresh.  This is either a repeater on a weakness leftover from the 1/20-1/22 cycle, or a slide on buried surface hoar from 2/3-ish.    Significant debris from yesterday's wet-loose activity originating in steep SE facing cliffs above Bonkers.",

Steep, narrow, sheltered, and shaded gully with a very difficult exit to the road. Very complex terrain that I'm not very familiar with and, in retrospect, should not have been in. 2 ski tracks going into it, 2 coming out, quick beacon search yielded no results. I don't think the debris was deep enough to bury someone unless they were really unlucky, but there were multiple terrain features that could have serious consequences (trees, rocks, gully). Cracking occured over a wide area but it actually ran in a much smaller area, through some trees and into another steep, narrow gully. The bed surface was a thin facet layer above a hard refrozen layer, perhaps 2 1/2 ft total snow depth ( I forgot to measure the total depth). It is noteworthy that this happened at a low elevation; only a few hundred ft above and within sight of the road.\n",

One interesting note is that UDOT shot White Pine before the road was opened, then this natural avalanche happened after it was open. They closed it and shot again and didn't trigger any slides.\n\nIt is a good heads up for us traveling in the backcountry to give ourselves a wide margin for error.

The last significant release was between 14:00-15:00 and ran several hundred vertical feet.  The drainage was a mixed bag of orange-peel, wind-effected snow, settled powder, and sun-effected mank.  Good, safe skiing was found on mid elevation terrain features in the middle of the drainage.  Snowmobilers were getting after it with their high marking in the Outhouse Chutes and the Y-Not zone.

At the ridge I noticed a very large, very fresh debris pile in the bottom of upper days fork.  Worried that the party in front of us had dropped north, my partner and I followed their tracks up the ridge to make sure they were not involved. Thankfully, their tracks ended up descending into Toledo bowl. Not sure if they had set it off with cornice drop or the like, but neither me or my partner noticed any disturbance in the snow near the ridge.  We decided to traverses east to Emma 2.

Stomped on cornice and it released, pulling out a soft slab 350' wide. Isolated to the ridge crest, the slab tapered from 12\" deep to 3\" over a vertical span of about 20' though once moving, it entrained loose surface snow and ran for about 500' vertical feet. \n\n\n",

Several D1 and D2 slides ran on Francis Peak, Thurston Peak, and Mount Ogden. There were a few SW avalanches and plenty of W. Noteworthy were the half dozen or so NW D2 avalanches running at the upper elevations (as high as 9500ft or so near the summit of Francis Peak). Clearly, northerly aspects are now potentially active zones for avalanches.\n\n \n\nI was nowhere near there today, but the mention of glide avalanches in the forecast reminded me that Chilly Peak Slabs have glide avalanched in the past. This might not be common knowledge for folks new to the area/new to touring. It's worth giving that zone a wide berth this time of year.\n",

There were snowmobile tracks in the vicinity, and it may have been triggered remotely. Slide appeared to have been initiated on the right flank in it's shallower area. In this area the slides weak layer was the mid pack facets. It then appeared to propagate downhill and step down at the middle of the crown. It went into the basal/early season facets leaving 4 inches of moderate sized Depth Hoar. As it descended over a rollover 80 feet downhill, it gouged out to the ground. Depth of slide at its apex was 34 inches, and this was after the last three days of warming. It had knife hard chunks in the debris and it's size was R2, D2. There was an inch or two of wind blown snow filling in the crown.  \n",

After 5 or 6 turns I triggered the slide. I noticed the movement and rode off to the side. The storm slab moved very slowly. With the addition of some cross loading from the previous days NW winds, the new snow was bonding poorly to the solar crust. Drew's forecast was spot on today. Thankfully this was in non consequential terrain with no one caught or carried. Heuristic trap: terrain familiarity.\n\n \n\n\n",

Collapsing is still happening as this persistent weakness gets it's first real test. \n\nI triggered this small avalanche from a 30 degree slope that failed and released where the slope angle approached 35 degrees. NE aspect at 10,100'. A quick crown profile indicated two important things. (1) I was unable to isolate a column along its flanks even after the slope had collapsed, and failure was in the well documented December depth hoar, but (2) much weak snow still remained in the bed surface. \n",
          "Comments 2": "Very Poor structure abounds. This snow profile was taken at 10,200', E-facing West Bowl. HS 63cm. The Mid-Dec. slab varies from 30-40cm thick and is resting on top of F hard 4mm depth hoar. Stability tests continue to fail easily and propagate along the entire column. There's no wishing this avalanche problem away. It will be with us until either it avalanches or gets compressed by lots more snow. ",

We were loosely following a burried but visible existing skin track. We came around a corner to find a small, steep, and relatively isolated slope under a rock band. The rocks were about 35 feet above us and the slope was 20 feet wide.  After discussing options/precautions, skier 2 (submitter) stayed back in a safe spot while skier 1 stepped out into the slope. Skier 1's steps quickly triggered a slide in the new snow layer--roughly 6\" on average and starting all the way from the rocks above. Skier 1 stayed in place on their feet during the slide then continued across to sub 30 degree terrain just beyond the slope. \n\n \n\nThe slide was 20 feet wide and went 200+ feet downhill. At it's deepest, the new snow layer there was 8\" but was only 3\" up at the rocks. The slope where skier 1 triggered it from was 39 degrees. At it's steepest by the rocks above, we would estimate the slope was nearly 45 degrees. \n\n \n\nOverall the slide was small and the skier had no trouble standing in place while it happened. No movement at all in the 33 degree and 28 degree terrain over ridges on either side. However, we both immeadiately recognized that in larger terrain, the same situation could have been much worse. We double checked our plan and adjusted for extra caution.\n\n \n\nContinued our day and saw no other red flags above this point. However, we were getting a lot of sluffing, cracking, and movement in the snow at much lower elevations on our way out.\n\n \n\nIt was a nice reminder that established skin tracks are not always the best option. On our way out we realized cutting over 250' lower in elevation would have completed avoided this terrain. \n\n \n\n \n",

Our runs off Cardiff Peak and Powerline Ridge were all dry loose powder.\n\n \nOn Cardiac Ridge we witnessed two relatively small loose avalanches (perhaps D1.5) but they ran a long way, a few hundred feet at least, in popular terrain and across a skin track. All upper elevation east facing alpine terrain. The first photo is a dry loose (likely triggered from warming) that pulled out from the upper quarter of Thunderstruck Couloir and ran almost to the bottom of the apron. We saw this happen in real time and while it was running relatively slowly, it would have ruined your day. This released right around 12pm. The second photo happened between 11:30 and 12. A solo skier narrowly avoided this one. Similarly, I don’t think it was enough snow to bury a human but definitely cause an injury. \n \n\nNo huge suprise with the temps spiking, but just a heads up. \n\n",

They administered CPR until Sanpete County searchers arrived and called in a Life Flight helicopter. The 26-year-old was flown to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo where he was pronounced dead.\n An hour later, a snowmobiler was buried in an avalanche east of Mount Pleasant in the Choke Cherry Ridge area, Lyon said. David Wayne Johnson, 42, of South Jordan, was dug out by searchers and flown to Sanpete Valley Hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n Craig Gordon, an avalanche forecaster at the U.S. Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center, said this winter is shaping up to be an unusual - and deadly - season for avalanches. Six people have perished in slides so far this winter, equaling the death toll of 2000-2001, according to Avalanche Center records.\n \"This is an unusual weather pattern, and unusual weather tends to produce unusual avalanches,\" Gordon said. A steady stream of storms in the region have brought high winds, heavy snowfall and fluctuating temperatures - \"the perfect recipe for a slab avalanche,\" he said.\n On Saturday, the mountains were blasted with winds up to 100 mph and between 6 and 8 inches of snow was forecast that night, said Bruce Tremper, director of the Avalanche Center.\n \"It's kind of a 'triple whammy,' as we call it,\" he said. \"We get snow, dense and heavy, extremely strong winds and warming temperatures. People without good avalanche skills should definitely avoid the backcountry.\"\n Avalanche danger continues to be high for all Utah mountains, even for low-elevation terrain, Tremper said.\n While snow, rain and wind pelted other parts of Utah, Saturday in the Salt Lake Valley was sunny and dry. Though strong southerly winds whipped through parts of Salt Lake City on Friday night and Saturday, the majority of a large West Coast storm wasn't expected to produce snow in the valley until after midnight.\n \"The main storm itself is somewhat stationary along the West Coast,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Tardy said.\n Several inches of snow fell Saturday afternoon in Logan, Price and Heber, Tardy said. Alta Ski Resort has received about 18 inches of new snow since Friday, 6 of which fell Saturday, he said.\n Winds gusting 30 to 40 mph were recorded in Salt Lake County, with some gusts reaching as high as 49 mph at the airport, Tardy said. High winds reaching up to 90 mph continued blowing in areas of the Wasatch Mountains.\n Snow in Salt Lake City could turn to light rain today with temperatures reaching the mid 40s. More rain was expected Monday, with snow returning to the valley Tuesday, Tardy said.\n jbergreen@sltrib.com,\n lrosetta@sltrib.com\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAvalanches Kill Two in Central Utah\nJan. 8, 2005\n\nSam Penrod reporting\n\nAnother deadly weekend in Utah's backcountry, as two avalanches kill two people in Central Utah. The slides both happened in Sanpete County Saturday afternoon, about an hour apart.\n\nIt's been a tragic day in Sanpete County. Two men were killed in separate slides, while snowboarding and snowmobiling this afternoon.\n\nIn the mountains east of Mt. Pleasant, a group of snowmobilers were in the area, when one of them apparently triggered an avalanche, around 2:00 this afternoon. One person was buried in the slide, but those in the group eventually were able to dig the victim out. But he could not be revived.\n\nSaturday evening, volunteers from the Sanpete County Search and Rescue were able to recover the victim from the avalanche.\n\nSheriff Kay Larsen/ Sanpete County Sheriff's Office: \"There was approximately ten people up there snowmobiling together. They had lost sight of him and could see the tracks where it had slid, and went down there. [They were] able to get him out of the snow, but unable to revive him.\"\n\nAbout an hour before the Mt. Pleasant slide, a 26 year old man who was snowboarding got caught in an avalanche in Ephraim Canyon. The victim was buried in the slide, but was wearing an avalanche beacon and someone who was with him was able to dig him out and started CPR.\n\nThe victim was airlifted to Utah Valley Medical Center where he died.\n\nTonight authorities are identifying the victim as 26 year old Louk Gordon from Ephraim. And in the Mt. Pleasant slide, 42 year old David Wayne Johnson of South Jordan was killed.\n\nAuthorities say heavy snow earlier in the week and then the warmer temperatures today likely caused both slides.\n\nAvalanche Warning\n\nThose fatalities make five avalanche-related deaths in the last month.\n\nAnother smaller avalanche-- about 4-feet deep-- has closed the road up Little Cottonwood Canyon. Authorities are telling everyone to get out. An avalanche warning is in effect for ALL Utah mountains, and that warning will remain in effect for the rest of the weekend.",

          "Comments 1": "There is a steep rollover at the bottom of Main Days.  A small, short sweet slope with a wider, less steep slope to skiers left.  It looked delectable and I center punched it.  Two turns in I saw the cracks form and most of it let loose.  It was somewhat similar to a big sluff, but it had a crown and it was a slab.  I took a short ride.  I tried to ski off to the side and missed the brunt, but I discovered it is difficult to ski to the side when the slope is moving downhill.  I ended up mostly covered with snow, but I wouldn't say I was buried.  I did lose my prescription sunglasses and was very lucky and grateful to find them. \n\nI did not measure the slope angle so 40 degrees is an estimate.  I did not inspect the bed surface, although I am reasonably confident is was the new snow-old snow interface.  The 5 turns I made at the bottom of the little avalanche were soft, and creamy.  Slabs are difficult to identify.\n\nWe had previously skied a NE facing aspect of Upper Days.  Skied a WSW aspect of upper days afterwards.  Went up a questionable skin track up the Days headwall to exit.  Saw no signs of instability and the snow didn't feel slabby to me.  Face shots were not abundant but did occur.  \n\nAs I watched people ski the days headwall, which had more snow, I wondered how different the conditions were on those aspects compared to what slid on me.  I think not much.  A couple of degrees in steepness and few degrees in aspect.  The skiing was fabulous and will be better tomorrow.  I think most of us tease the dragon more than we know.  ",

          "Comments 1": "Our party of 4 spent the morning in Cardiff. We were aware of the forecast and our primary concern was wind loading/wind slabs. After skiing 2 different lines in the drainage without much evidence of wind load, we decided to ascend the northeast facing collie between Cardiac Ridge and Ivory Flakes. As we ascended we took note of areas of obvious wind loading and worked to avoid these as we skinned up toward the top of the collie. Nearing the top of the ascent, we noticed a significant change in the snow as it became much more stiff. We discussed this and continued ascending working to aboid the obvious wind slab. As the chute narrowed toward the top we ended up bumping up against the slab on the skinner. We then saw out first shooting crack of the day the slab paused after cracking and then released. The slab broke just uphill of the lead skinner, who was able to step off of the slab. Second skinner in line was caught on the slab and took a 40 foot ride down the chute before self arresting. The slab contined down the chute and onto the apron. Slide was D1 in size. \n",

No cracking either and the snow was still light/hadn't heated up yet, so we decided Bombay chute would be relatively safe to ski as long as there was a safe entrance into the chute and we could get well below the cornice. There was a safe entrance and the chute skied well. The snowpack was a little punchy skiing down, but otherwise felt stable. About a minute after both myself and my friend got down and were in a safe zone, we were looking back up at the chute and observed a natural cornice break that fanned into a dry loose avalanche that could have easily carried a rider over a small but rocky cliff band had someone been in the chute at the time. \n",

There were a few tracks along the ridge before our party reached it and two ahead of me did not have any issues. I went about 40 yards past where my buddy dropped. The aspect changed slightly north at this point and was a bit more exposed and wind blown. The snow pack was about 2 feet deep on the slope and it was a bit more open at the top than areas surrounding it. Forecaster's note - see small arrow in middle of second picture for location. The slope started to break apart around me on my first turn it. It was a soft sugary slab that I though would just sluff off. Fortunately I let my momentum carry me skiers right to get on more stable ground and let it sluff off. I was scraping rocks by the time I got good footing and could grab a tree. The slab actually gained strengh and widened quickly. It sheared at the snow/ground interface and moved into the trees. The trees did not provide an anchor and it continued to widen and gain strength. It finally ran out after 400 or so vertical feet. Getting caught would not have been good.",

The snow is highly wind affected in the foothills right now, and I got careless given how thin and anchored the snowpack is in most places. The snow broke on faceted snow.\n\nI was making my way down the northwest face of the peak, basically just traversing and doing kickturns given the mix of breakable crust, ice, and wind drifts and ended up on a very obvious wind slab on a ~35 degree slope. My second traverse on it I heard a whumpf/cracking sound and the snow around me fractured. Fortunately, the snowpack isn't very deep so I think I only got carried maybe 3-5ft on my side, very slowly, before I basically sunk down to the faceted snow and thus grippy snow below that and came to a stop using my skis and poles.\n\n \n\nFrom where I stopped the crown was about 10ft above me and was anywhere from 1ft-2ft thick and went diagonal along the slope.\n",

Photo shows the weak early Dec. drought layer marked as the weak layer and the rime crust layer above. This photo is a good example of why the drought layer is still the player of concern in the area being mid-snowpack and well within the top meter of snow.

These were mostly located on the southwest facing steeper terrain on the East side of the normal skin track right off of the Butler Fork trail head. The largest on was likely around 70 feet wide and definitely large enough to knock a person off of their feet into the terrain trap below. I measured the slope angle in a couple of places and found it to be about 45 degrees where the slides occurred, with crowns about 8-10 inches deep. The cause of the slides may have been due to the upside down new that was noticeable throughout the morning forming a small slab that slid on the new snow old snow interface, although I didn't have time to dig into the details this morning. Overall a minor slide here that could be very telling for bigger, steeper terrain today. \n",

Approximately 32\" of snow and 2.5\" SWE fell between Jan 22-30, with the last 8\"-12\" (.6-1.0\" SWE) falling on the night of the 30th. A three day period of sustained 25-35 mph southerly winds occurred mid-week, in between storm systems.  \n\n \n\nI had just finished digging a pit in the trees north of the Coyote Chute starting zone. Results were ECTP 23 on November facets about a meter down. I walked on to the northern edge of the bowl that makes up the starting zone for Coyote Chute to see if it would collapse. It did and I heard a low deep whumph followed by successive whumphs across the bowl and I could see cracks all the way across it for approximately 300'. It did not slide. At that point, the aspect changes to more easterly and the slope disappears from sight. I walked up to the ridge and discovered the avalanche another 200' beyond. All told I triggered it from 500' away. \n\n\n\nSnowpit dug nearby showing my ECTP 23 results on the November facets. Discussion of the snowpack in the video below. All done prior to the avalanche. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of the avalanche.

Crowns appeared 12-20 inches. Assuming some were explosive triggered yesterday morning as many flanks had debris covered in a couple inches of snow. Fresh debris without snow ran from at least 10500 down to about 7800 feet into Tanner Gully with a very large debris pile. Upper portions of more skiiers left chute also with debris, but did not run all the way through. \n\n \n\nQuick hand pit on south facing slope that had not slid at about 9800 feet showed a 1.5 inch thick presumed freeze/melt crust under about 12 inches of snow with a fairly cohesive slab and decision was made to turn around. \n",

The cornice failure looked to have triggered several avalanches down slope on the Northerly aspect. The most notable was the slide in the skiers right side of the prominent slide path \"the other runs\" which failed from the top of slope. Sliding on what looked to be close to the ground as rocks and shrubs were still visible. We could not investigate the crown or bed surface as new snow and wind loading had already began to reload the slope. This run was in our groups closed run list so a proper investigation was not warranted.  The second most notable slide was roughly 60' down slope in the wide spaced trees east of The Other Runs main slide path. This looked to be a step down with roughly a three foot crown. Probe pole depths of the remaining fracture material were 185cm-225cm deep.  Our group initially noticed a small hole close to the tree line on the ridge and as we looked closer we traced the fracture running east. Many blocks of  multiple fractures remian on the ridge and are much farther back in the root of the cornice than expected and snow bridging has already begun.\n\n \n\nNote: this ridge line should be traveled with cation as new cornice has already developed. Collapsing a snow bridge above an existing fracture could result in a leg injury. This ridgeline is best traveled with a probe to identify that you are not on the leeward (wind loaded) area of the ridgeline. \n",

We went back and inspected the crown and had some good pictures so I figure we would submit a report as well. \n\n\t \n\n\tWe skinned up to the top of Red Top from the White Pine parking lot. A man and a women were behind us as we ascended Red Top. On the ascent it was around 30 degrees F but the wind was blowing 25-30mph gusting to 40mph. As we skinned we mentioned to each other multiple times that it seemed odd that there was not a section on wind slabs in the morning avalanche report. We skinned to the far skiers right chute and the group behind us stopped above the middle chute. The first skier in on our run popped out a small wind slab but it didn't run and was easily avoided. \n\t \n\n\tForecaster note: Sometimes we hate forecasting in spring because the weather is so changeable. The winds were not \"supposed\" to blow very hard. Spring! If it isn't one thing it's another.\n\n\t \n\n\tWhen we got to the bottom we saw that the group behind us had triggered a large avalanche. We skied over to make sure they were both okay. The man said he had triggered the avalanche at the top and ended above the snow almost at the toe of the debris. He was very shaken up. He was super lucky and definitely knew it. He was able to find both skis but lost a pole and his goggles and hat. He was able to ski back down, but said that his right ankle hurt a bit. The woman had skied down after him and was unharmed but also a bit shaken up. \n\n\t \n\n\tWe skinned back up to the top for a second run and to take a look at the crown. It looked like the man had skied first and as he traversed into the run he was on top of a hard slab that broke almost 50ft above him. The crown was only 25 ft wide but almost 2ft deep initially then broke a shallow wind slab down the whole west facing ridgeline around 150ft wide and maybe 5 inches deep (however it was hard to tell how deep the slab was because by the time we got back to the top it had almost filled back in). The avalanche ran over rocks and through a choke pulling the old soft snow with it. As the avalanche hit the apron it fanned out. The debris pile was only between 2 and 3 feet deep, however there were still chunks of snow 3ft by 3ft by 2ft.\n\n\t \n\n\tVery glad that everybody was okay, and definitely a learning experience for me.

The path was fairly filled in when I saw this thing at 1630 so my guess is that it released in the morning during the more intense snow and wind. 36 degrees in steepness at the crown and it ran about 200'. I had not had much results from hand shears on my way up, I dug a CT in the flank and got CTE7RP 40cm down, along with a moderate shovel shear on the same layer. Lower down on the steep N facing gully walls above the Silver Fork drainage I saw a similar slide that looked identical to this one in depth but quite a bit wider. \n",

Because of their top point I had eyes on them most of my skin back out.. I watched first guy come down and stop about 1/3 way down run. His partner headed down and crashed in crust layers.I watched him get up met with his partner and both headed down the drainage of Red cliffs. When they crossed the next drainage ( mother in law chute)  they triggered slide from below. The slide covered some of their tracks and I witnessed them ski out out onto Squaretop Lake. Since I don't see their report I thought I should let you all know that the point has come to a HEAD! Be careful out there and Watch Out for the other guy!\n",

The rider tries to deploy his airbag, though is unable to successfully engage and he's buried with a hand sticking out of the snow. The sledder briefly loses consciousness, but everyone in the group is wearing avalanche rescue gear and they quickly locate the buried rider and dig him out. The group is pretty rattled, but after taking some time to regroup in the Whitney Basin warming hut, they ride back to their rigs and return home safely.. Whew... close call!\n\n",

From the activity observed in the Brighton Periphery, it appears that this slide would have been a Storm Slab with a contributing Wind aided factor. Of note, in the Brighton area, there was a significant density break issue directly above the old snow new snow interface from yesterdays 4 to 6 inches where it interfaced with the new 15 inches from Monday night into mid morning hours on Tuesday. Speculation would have the possibility of a Melt Layer Recrystallization occurring at the melt freeze layer prior to Mondays event under the minimal melt freeze that occurred Monday afternoon due to daytime highs and ambient heating. Regardless, whether this is true or not, there was a definite density break issue at this layer. The wide propagation was unusual and propagation was able to be initiated by our parties in many areas where wind loading had consolidated the Storm Slab. In the Brighton area, these were soft slabs ranging from 24 to 8 inches deep, with widths of up to 150 feet. They ran to transitions.  \n",

          "Comments 1": "My wife and I had a great morning boarding in Mill D North Fork.  For most of the morning temps were nice and cold and the new snow stayed light and powdery and everything seemed very stable.  As the day wore on and the temps and sun rose, the snow started to get more damp and stick to my skins so we figured it was time to leave.  We headed back to the car by taking a relatively direct route from the top of Reynolds down the South face back to the Mill D parking lot.  The conditions on that aspect were about 5 inches of new snow on top of a solid and slick sun crust.    As my wife descended first she initiated a small point release behind her which looked like minor sloughing of the new snow on top of the sun crust.  It moved pretty slowly (never more than 10-15 mph max) but started to get wider and pick up more and more snow.  It eventually caught up to her when she stopped and carried her for about 50 feet until she grabbed a small tree and it continued (still slowly) another couple hundred feet.  The whole thing probably lasted more than a minute and carved all the new snow off the slope down to the sun crust.  It never moved quickly or violently and didn't seem like it would have buried anybody but it would not have been pleasant had it pulled anyone over a cliff or other hazard.  In retrospect we underestimated how fast the sun and rapidly warming temperatures were changing the snow conditions.  We also could have chosen any number of less direct return routes to the car that would not have been nearly as susceptible to this type of activity which was clearly predicted in the morning avalanche advisory.  It is interesting to note that the underlying crust was so slick it seemed that the wet snow continued sliding on slope angles that were substantially less than 30 degrees.",

The skier was carried approximately 60-80 yards down the hill but remained on top of the snow. All three in the party had equipment taken down the hill with the slide but all was recovered. Snow observation and conditions at the time were stable there were no rollers as seen in photos during the approach. Reported by a secondary party who was skiing Bonkers that another party had passed them and summited the ridge of Bonkers at the time the avalanche occurred it is suspected that snow was kicked off the top causing the wet slide to come down and hit our party.  \nClose call could have been a lot worse.\nA reminder to know what is below you before kicking snow down!\nAfter the slide the route plans changed and all in the party made it down safely. \nBelow is a photo of the approach to Bonkers with the cliffs above where the snow came off.\n\n\n\nForecaster note: I switched trigger to unknown.  This slide could have been triggered by a party above or it could have initiated by snow coming off the warming rocks.

Crown appeared to be about 5-6' deep and a few hundred feet wide, but hard to tell from such a distance. Also noted a few dry loose slides high in the Sox's area that did not break into a deeper layer.\n\n\n\n(N. Pearson) One of many naturals that went in Porter fork during high PI rate on the eveing of the 13th. This one ran in the corner pocket of iceboxin Main Porter about 100 lower than the ridge. The Majority of this slide had about 4-6 foot crown. Broke all the way around to the northwest facing steep slope with a 2-3 foot crown on average. I estimate this slide to be about 400-600 ft wide. Debris ran down the gully about 1000 ft and deposited in the flats. Takeaway from this and many other very large slides in the area is to activily aviod gullies, be congnisant of overhead hazard that may be 300-1000+ feet above you, and don't trust some of the standard skin tracks in the area. There is a lot of danger in the Porter Fork area in Milcreek. These large slopes are primed and ready to fail if they haven't already done so. There is plenty of snow hanging out on the rest of Icebox that could result in a slide 2-3 times larger.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n",

          "Comments 1": "Dimensions are approximate from viewing from the toe of the debris.\n\nI was up in this area with my pals from the UDOT snow safety team about a week ago during the high pressure.  We all noted how weak the snow was in this area.  Both the surface and near the ground had weak faceted snow and we speculated that it was weak enough that it wouldn't hold much weight from new snow storms.  Looks like our assumptions were right.  It was difficult to see the initial fracture but the avalanche definitely ended up gouging to the ground as it ran.  Wind drifting no doubt played a role here.\n\nWe didn't really guess on how much water it would take before avalanches occurred but I attempted to measure it today.  It was a bit difficult due to how much the wind had stirred things up but my rough measurements were 14.5\" of snow over the last week on top of the old faceted snow surface.  The 14.5\" of snow contained about 1.6\" of water.\n\nOf note, the paths that threaten the road lower in the canyon still don't hold much total snow.  At the forks of the Huntington I measured 6\" that fell over the last week.  It contained .47\" water.\n\nBelow, decent pile of debris with a few logs in it.\n",
          "Comments 2": "Also of note, the wind direction did not lend to loading the large road cut near the Electric Lake Dam which is a usual suspect of hitting the road. The strong northwest wind actually stripped it rather than loading it.",
          "Comments 3": "Assessment: This storm ended just as the scales were about to be tipped. A few more hours of snow and wind and this area would have gone through a much more widespread natural avalanche cycle. This was the only notable avalanche that I was able to see. The weak snow remains near the ground now with a decent slab on it. It will be need to be monitored with any significant new snow storm.",
          "Comments 4": "This small avalanche did break off a few trees but it probably didn't take much to snap them since this was the site of a large forest fire. All of the trees are just charred trunks that have been standing for a number of years.",

          "Comments 1": "I'd been skiing Silver, Days, and Emma all morning/early afternoon, and dropped down a line that's to the right of Doug's Drop (on the Silver/Days ridgeline).  it starts mellow, then rolls over briefly to 40+ degrees, then backs off again.  There was one track down the slope from this morning (when it was colder).  The snow had been pretty decent powder, but the sun poking through - as per Trent's forecast - but with considerable cloudiness made it seem like things were greenhousing in the early afternoon.  I thought that a high, east-facing shot would have better snow and be a little safer.  I dropped down the lower angle bit, went around the rocky entrance to the chute, then dropped in skiing fast and - channeling my inner snowboarder (which isn't too deep; I pondered riding my board today) I skied it off fall line with the prospect of a slow, wet slab following me down (thinking about Ian McCammon's slope angle study that indicates that wet slides need more pitch than powder soft/hard slabs:  http://gblanc.fr/IMG/pdf/mccammon2009.pdf ) \n\nOnce down in the flats I stopped, turned and indeed I saw a wet slide trundling down the slope.  It wasn't moving fast, but having been caught in wet slides before, I knew that it had a bit of that \"heavy\" power.  The \"crown\" was literally a few inches deep in the steepest part of the chute where my entrance ski cut was, but the entrainment of plenty of snow was notable.  It ran down to where the slope backed off to the mid-20's and stopped.    The debris was not deep enough to bury someone but enough to pull of a (releasable!) ski binding and bury that, and maybe tweak a knee (which has happened to me).  \n\nI needed to exit the Emmas and they were even gooier, so I was quite careful to keep my slope angles under 40 with the little rolls and terrain traps in there, and that worked out fine.  \n",

          "Comments 1": "Spotted this slide on the drive to work today.  My first thought was human caused, but after looking around at the debris which had a few inches of new snow on top, this likely occurred from gusty winds overloading the buried weak facets.  Or possibly this was triggered from riders on the ridge which I could not confirm.   The avalanche depth ranged from a couple feet to over 6' and failed on facets above a crust formed back in October.  Walking up the bed surface there was still a slick firm crust with weak sugary snow that will get buried with future storms and this could be a repeater slide later this winter.  \n\n\nFORECASTER NOTE- Ted knows the western Uinta's better than anyone around and his observations, snow and avy expertise are top notch. We were a bit baffled by this one. The tracks near the slope were from yesterday's group of riders who DID NOT trigger the slide.... there was a few inches of snow on the bed surface from the night before.  We talked this one through and concluded the slide was remotely triggered either from low on the slope or from the ridge above Yamaha Hill.",

The slide ran pretty fast and far, traveling the whole length of the chute. It did not step down to any deeper layers. Not deep enough to bury someone but definitely could have taken someone for a ride if they got caught. Today this problem was manageable but these windslabs developed in just a few hours of higher winds, so if winds continue to blow I would expect potentially deeper slabs tomorrow.\n",

          "Comments 1": "Working at Soldier Hollow Biathlon. On the morning of the 15th noticed the three slides on the East, South East face of Mill Canyon Peak. Temptation, Tom's Canyon and Left side of Tommy Gun. The whole East face basin off the top of the Peak had released with the crown face, Approx. 6'-4' x 1/4 mile long? Plus raced around the north corner of the basin. It is identified as Temptation in the Wastach Back Country map.\n\nThe two other slides, most of Tom's Canyon & the left lower side of Tommy Gun slide. There was a minor earthquake early that morning, just saying. Can not say for sure that was the cause of all three releasing but it would be interesting to check out the debris pile in the bottom of the Temptation basin. I have attached images of the three slides, one of all three and a topo with approx. placement. It was eye opening. \n",

My wife and I were the two skiers in the party. We had skied the same run on Banana Days about 90 minutes before. It was warming up and in hindsight, while we were certainly aware of the large cornices, we perhaps should have not skied that run again. My wife skied first and her plan was to quickly ski through the chute and out onto the wide apron. I was watching from a safe spot. She was about 200' down when I saw the cornice crack. I yelled at her and she was able to quickly cut a straight line to her right and out of harm's way. Fortunately the cornice did not trigger any type of slab. I quickly skied to the last place I saw her and then heard her yelling from below that she was OK. I followed her tracks to the right.\n\n \n\nThe lesson here for us was a reminder that cornices can go at any time, but they are especially scary when the sun is beating down. \n",

          "Comments 4": "From another party-\n\n\n\nRemotely triggered slide on banana belt observed from the skin track up chicken shit ridge. The first skier was about 150-200' down banana belt and exiting the choke of the chute just below a lot of cliff bands. ~10,000ft, NE facing. The ridge above was heavily corniced above the cliffs. Skier was able to exit to their right to avoid the slide which broke above them, the second skier in the party descended the same path quickly after and appeared to be situated on the ridge further to skiers right of the cornice failure at the time of the slide. Both skiers were able to ski down unharmed. After assessing the terrain and situation as best we could from our vantage point, we determined it was most likely a remote trigger of a cornice on the ridge which then fell through the cliffs and into the run, taking a decent amount of snow from the cliffs with it. Slide was about 40' wide and ran about 300' vertically. The sun was out in force at the time of the incident (about 12:15pm). Although the slope was mostly shaded, the cornices on the ridge were getting hit pretty hard in the sun. The slide did not appear to have been a cohesive slab, but definitely did have enough volume from the cornice and cliff face to have taken a person for quite a ride, potentially through some trees.\n\n",

          "Comments 4": "A UDOT maintenance worker witnessed a natural avalanche at about 12:30 pm on Wednesday, January 11. It occurred directly across the highway from a popular parking lot for riders coming off the backside of Beaver Mountain (out of bounds). No one was caught in the slide. He immediately notified his crew and closed the highway. Paige Pagnucco (UAC and UDOT forecaster) responded from Beaver Mountain and traveled to the avalanche site to assess the situation. It was quickly determined that with forecast continued heavy snowfall and strong winds, the road would remain closed. UDOT, UHP and Beaver Mountain staff worked in cooperation to create a plan to get people safely down Logan Canyon.\n\nBill Nalli (UDOT avalanche supervisor) was notified immediately when the avalanche occurred and he traveled to Logan to help evaluate and mitigate the avalanche danger. Once the road was closed and cleared, UDOT mitigated determined areas of avalanche danger with explosives. The canyon re-opened the following morning with no further incident. \n\nPaige Pagnucco investigated the avalanche on 1/12/17 and found the weak layer to be small facets sitting just under a thick but brittle crust about 50 cm up from the ground. The area is very rocky underneath the bed surface and facets of various sizes exist. The trigger appears to be the intensified snowfall rate that occurred during that time. Combined with strong winds, the weight of the new snow overloaded the weak layer and caused it to fail . The avalanche occurred on the lee side of a small subridge. The height of the slab was 85-110 cm. \n\nBoth lanes of the highway were covered with about 4-5' of debris for about 150'. \n\n ",

On their last run, they skied off the NE side of Peak 9924, which is on the ridge between Broads Fork and Mill B South. It is a 2,000 vertical foot run. The upper half is a 35-degree slope through gladed trees and looks like a deceptively easy descent but the lower half rolls over into a series of cliffs the bottom of the Mill B South drainage.\nTwo skiers descended partway and waited in some trees. The third skier started down while the fourth skier waited on the ridge. The third skier got about 4 turns into the run when he triggered a large, hard-slab avalanche about 3-4 feet deep and quite wide. He yelled \"Avalanche!\" to the others below and one was able to grab a tree and the other scrambled out of the way. The third skier was going to deploy his avalanche airbag pack but he impacted a tree before he could pull the trigger. The tree stopped him and the debris washed over him and buried him with his head sticking out. He injured his knee in the impact with the tree. The fourth skier on top came down with his beacon on receive and found the third skier and helped him get out. Luckily no one took the full ride to the bottom because it would most likely be un-survivable because it descended through gladed trees and over several cliffs on its 2,000 vertical foot path.\nThe injured skier hobbled down, sliding on his rear much of the way. He found one of his skis about halfway down. It was difficult negotiating the various cliff bands. At the bottom, he was able to ski out on one ski. He was obviously very lucky.",

Found no instability on the windward south facing ascent but quite the opposite just off the ridgeline from 7000 down to 6500 ft where the wind has transported and loaded the S/SE leeward ridgeline. Knowing the instability, we descended the ridgeline and found a good test slope. As soon as I stepped onto it a crack propagated and the slope released. No pop, not a lot of energy, but it could have carried and buried a skier if it had room to run and entrain more snow. Snow broke on soft fist hard rain crust from earlier in the storm.\n\nWith this event we chose to ski dense pines on N facing slope. Found no additional instability. \n",

          "Comments 1": "This slide was triggered a few minutes before my party reached the saddle directly east of Little Superior.  The party of 2 at the saddle had seen it slide.  They said they thought it was naturally triggered. However, another party was above the slide skinning up (on the south side of Little Superior), and I suspect that it could have also been remotely triggered by them.  The winds were blowing about 20 to 30 m/h from the NNW onto the SE facing slope.  Winds were not very prevalent in most areas and were mostly confined to this area and summits.  The crown was about 18\" to 24\" deep.  It ran with several slabs of snow remaining on the slope, but also entrained snow.  Near the bottom of our descent on Two Trees, we observed a fresh debris pile that covered the tracks from yesterday.  We expect that it ran about 1300 vertical feet or more.  Time was a concern for my party so we did not investigate the slide further (hardness of the slab is an estimate). \n\nThe party that (may have) triggered the slide, were not caught and traversed SW across the south side of Little Superior.  We observed their tracks down the south facing nose of Little Superior.  The wind affected snow seemed very pockety and there were many absolutely tremendous options to ski down that were much safer.  \n\nObserver note: I counted about 30 headlamps at one time going up to Cardiff Pass and beyond.  Typical wasangles day.  It's important to pick routes carefully as well as be very observant and respectful about what and who is both above and below you.  ",

The slide ran the entire length of Suicide and stopped about 75-100 feet after the start of the Superior apron. Even though winds were well behaved on the apron and during the majority of the ascent, they were blowing fairly hard at the very top. The top 10 feet of the chute had a significantly slicker crust beneath the new snow than what we had encountered for the majority of the climb, making it difficult for us to set steps near the top. Given the slick crust at the top, its apparent the wind slab didn't need too much provocation to get moving.\nPhotos, which aren't the best quality, show part of the crown and then down the chute where you can see some remaining chunks left behind.",

We figured we could find some aspect that had not been hammered. We checked south and west facing areas and eventually settled on north facing trees, which skied well. On the way there though we triggered this very small slide from well over 200' away. The hairline cracking propagated over several hundred feet and grew in width to an inch or so.   The cracking started at the top of the first arrow and continued past the second. The whole set up was right out of the report today and slabs sensitive to body weight have clearly formed on above tree line leeward slopes.  The trick is that leeward seems to be about 2/3 of the compass, at least in this area. \n",

We were a bit suspicious and proceeded carefully.\n\n \n\nFirst and second skiers skied down with no issues. 3rd skier triggered a small wind slab pocket that propagated about 50' wide and ran about 100' long. Slow moving snow allowed skier to get out to safety easily (great reflex, he traversed and hid behind a tree). The small debris pile was not deep enough to burry a person but could have knocked you down easily.\n\n \n\nWe also skied West and East facing slopes through the day and did not encounter any other similar wind slabs. Just light fluffy dry powder everywhere else.\n\n \n\nThis was a small isolated pocket but I wonder how widespread the SW wind loading is out there.\n\nIf this had been loaded with more snow and had ran on a bigger slope it could have been a more serious slide.\n\nI will treat NE wind loaded slopes and gullies as suspect, especially with the new storm snow forecasted in the next 2 days that will cover them and make them harder to detect...\n\n \n",

The depth of the crown diminished along the left flank where there was less wind loading. \n\n \n\nThese avalanches most likely occurred on Wednesday 3/22 during the middle of a series of storms. The avalanche danger on 3/22 was rated HIGH. The snow started falling Sunday night into Monday 3/20 and by Wednesday the La Sals had received about 2 feet of snow and 2.6 - 3.0\" of SWE. Extreme winds out of the SW blew 50-70 mph Tuesday night and Wednesday. This slope was heavily wind loaded. The avalanche failed on 1mm facets down about 1.5 meters. This avalanche is an example of how strong winds can create unusual loading patterns in the mountains. \n\n \n\nHS-N-R2-D2.5-O\n",

          "Comments 1": "I observed a large natural slab avalanche on the steep North-facing slope one cirque West of the Desolation Lake cirque (proper).  It is the steep ridge between powder park (3?) and the Desolation Lake drainage.  I would identify it precisely on google maps except I am unable to zoom to accurately indicate the slide's location.  I have tried 3 different computers and I'm giving up.  Anyway, the avalalanche is BIG; probably a  thousand feet wide, give or take.  The Eastern extremity is a well defined crown just below the West \"summit\" of the ridge feature and the fracture continues West and down to the Western extremity of the ridge.  It wraps around sub-ridges and connects slopes most people might consider \"unconnected\".  We did not investigate closely, but it ran full track, started as (at least) all the storm snow, and appeared to step down into older snow.  This is the same slope that killed Alan Murphy's brother in-law back in the early 80s.  \n\nObservation time was 5:00 pm. Based on this statement: \" Interestingly, no natural activity observed above Desolation Lake and West Desolation Ridge, which both have similar aspects to Sheep Sh!t Ridge -- perhaps not as much wind exposure in these locations?\"  made by SD earlier the same day, we might suppose this slide occured mid to late afternoon.  It certainly looked as \"fresh as a daisy\".  No camera, no pic.\n\nNote: Seth Dromgoole emailed the following comments:\nJust wanted to respond to Fred's Avy Observation of West Desolation and my Avy Obs of Sheep Shit Ridge (I'm SD) on 2/9/14.  I had noted in my Obs that I didn't see slides in Deso or West Deso -- I was in the area around 3-3:30 pm.  Fred stated he saw the slide around 5 pm.  The slide must have occurred in the 1.5 hr gap.  Of note, when I was scanning that area I did notice a lone skier skinning along the ridge between Deso and West Deso, perhaps that skier triggered the slide?",

As we got closer we could see this was a small but impressive glide Avalanche which fell into a pronounced gully used to access to the higher terrain in the western drainage. Upon our exit we were able to closely examine the slide. Photos show our first sighting, closer views on ascent, images at the toe of the slide.\n\nAs we progressed higher toward our planned decent we encountered wind effects on steep north facing slopes, 35-40 degrees, and encountered a pronounced collapse with a loud ripping report which sent me skinning backwards with my orifices puckered. My partner felt the collapse then experienced cracking as he was moving toward me.  We bailed on our objective at that point. Very interesting day for a low to moderate rated day.

It was hard to tell exactly the time period that the faceted snow formed in. However, it was very easy to find weak snow in the snowpit wall in this location. There was a very strong (1 finger) slab on top of loose faceted snow. My best guess is this area was wind loaded from the strong SW winds over the past few weeks. It's a very steep (48° degree) rocky slope. ",

          "Comments 1": "Mark was out of town so we had to go to Cardiac Ridge oursleves on Friday.  Snow on the terrain ridden was about knee deep plus, inverted but nicely supportive for snowboards. Noteworthy was that there was a significant slide that occurred mid storm last week covering much of the width of cardiac ridge. There was enough new snow over the debris that the debris still rode well.  The slide seemed like it went slow and wide with debris height being only 1-1.5 feet above the rest of the snowpack at the lower portions.  All of the terrain in he photo slid other than the apron we rode and beneath the few moraines with scrubby trees in the area that aren't pictured. The terrain that did not slide has about 12-15\" of dense nice powder over maybe 6\" of lighter density-probably faceted snow.  It rode very well and no rocks were hit on the main slope. Some of this lower layer found up high and lower down was comprised of fine grained facets.\n\nHopefully the denser snow in the slide paths won't facet as thoroughly as it could have in the coming high pressure. Lower terrain was lively with lots rocks. Road down to BCC was mostly walk out at day's end and surely is all walking now.",

As the first of the group reached the top of the couloir and the second person stepped out onto the slope, the slope collapsed with two people on it. The second was caught and carried 300 ft down the slope. He self arrested with verts and his poles and was on top of the snow uninjured when he came to a stop. HS-ASr-U-R2-D1.5-O\n\nLessons: We were at a lower elevation and in one of the outlying areas where the PWL is more present... The snow in the couloir felt stable on the ascent. As we approached the final roll to the top we did not re-group to discuss continuing. It was cold and shady in the couloir and the top looked like great views, sunny and warm. I have skied the couloir in the past and knew that the top always has the convex roll over from wind loading.  I was tricked because the stubborn hard  slab was capped with 6-8 inches of fresh snow on top.  Although it was convex and in retrospect was obviously wind loaded it did not feel slabby on top and the verts were punching through the new snow and it felt supportable. It did not seem like the same persistent slab that slid was present futher than 15 or 20 feet down the couloir.  We felt that the heavy windloading at the convex roll was what activated the layer. As soon as the second stepped onto the slope with the first on top of the slab, the increased load was enough to cause a collapse and take the second for a ride. \n\nLooking at the convex roll we should have skied from just below it and not have tried to push for the top of the couloir. Looking back, it was obviously wind loaded. The stoke was high as we could see the sun and the phenomenal powder. We should have SLOWED DOWN and better communicated our concerns. I'm glad my partner(s) are okay. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n",

The debris shot out of the defile at the base of the Crows Foot\n\nwith very large chunks of muddy, damp, and hard snow.  It blasted through more\n\nof the previous debris over the road. It must have run quite a while.  I counted at\n\nleast 8 separate tracks.  Multiple tall vertical sided walls. More broken trees from\n\nabove.  The longest run went a full hundred yards further than the second\n\navalanche's.  Leaving a 30' wall stacked on the Second Left Hand trail.  The Toe is\n\nalmost to the base of the hill on the West side of the valley. (marker pin on map)\n\nBrutal, violent,and probably unnervingly loud for the duration. Did I mention\n\nreally dirty?  There used to be a forest of Maple, Box Elder, Aspen, and a few\n\npine.  Flattened better than a couple of Dozers with an anchor chain.\n\n \n\nSnowmobiles, Snow Bikes etc. won't be getting across or around for a while.\n\n \n\nNext the four open spaces East of the campground,  West aspect. The three larger ones\n\nran fairly big. With a plenty somewhat dirty debris.  None reached  the road. #4 was about\n\na third the size. All started high up near the top of the ridge.\n\n \n\nOn the south end of the face is a smaller, shallow damp run that ends above the\n\nmouth of Dry Fork.\n\n \n\nCrossing the dugways either side of  Second Right Hand overlook, there was a legit\n\nconcern of stepping  off the pack and having to deal with steep hard slab.  The West\n\none had a couple of places that had pulled out as if there was a glide going on.  Like\n\na little Bergschrund.  Sweet.\n",

Crown was around 18 inches deep, and pretty much cleaned out the entire snow pack to the dirt quite always down the slope. Assuming it released naturally in the early AM, and they probably both released at the same time or one sympathetic the other.  There were no tracks in the area.   Slide obviously pulled out on the old faceted snow from a couple weeks ago, my thinking is that the wind and new snow overloaded the weak facets underneath.  Nice debris pile in the island of trees at the bottom, definitely would have ruined your day.

While skinning along the ridge, one of the cornices broke without any assistance while two skiers passed by at what seemed like a perfectly safe distance from the edge (~4 feet). A huge chunk went down the hill and could have caused some serious damage/injury if anyone had been down below. It hit a couple of trees and split apart, but the largest chunk that made it all the way down was probably 6 feet long, 3 feet deep, and 3 feet wide. The fall triggered slough below, but it all seemed to be the top layer of the snowpack. There is still a fragile piece of the cornice that will likely fall soon (shown in the pictures).\n",

          "Comments 1": "We skinned up Slate Canyon on the afternoon of March 11. We were wary of this particular avalanche path given the recent rain, warming, and likely windloading off the top of Buckley. The debris deposit both from the most recent and previous avalanches was impressive. The debris pile was about 300 feet in length and looked to be 20+ feet deep in spots (hard to capture with pictures). It has completely wiped out the trail. The most recent debris ran full track down into the stream bed and some oven-size chunks of snow were visible. There was about an inch of snow over the debris, indicating that it avalanched the night of March 10 or early in the morning March 11, sometime before the snow subsided.\n\n \n\nFurther up-canyon, we dug a hasty pit at 7100' on an east-northeast facing slope. We found 1.5 meters of total snowpack. The top 20 or so inches of snow formed a thick, heavy cohesive slab and sat on loose, wet grains (maybe old facets that got soaked with the rain?). These grains were so loose that some would spill out as soon as we exposed them in the pit, and the cohesive slab on top was obvious while digging and with finger tests. Seems possible that the large debris pile we saw was the result of an avalanche that failed on this layer. Hard to say for sure. Upon seeing how cohesive the top slab of snow was and what it sat on, we proceeded carefully down the ridge we ascended. \n",

Fresh snow and sustained southwest winds steered me towards a cross-loaded slope to confirm suspicions. Standing on a lower angle portion of the slope (island of safety) I took off my skins, shifted my weight slightly, slid a ski tip into a fat portion of the drift in front of me and was able to trigger this fresh drift that was surprisingly tender and connected. Avy failed on a preserved layer of near surface facets. \n",

We noticed several recent avalanches, probably ran yesterday during the warm temperatures.  Sorry for the poor photos.  \n\nThe first was this very large avalanche in the North Fork of Cherry Creek.  The slide started near the ridgeline at 9200 feet, was 1/4 to 1/2 mile wide, and ran down to 7400 feet.  The slopes involved faced South east to West and encompassed several pockets that released likely during the same event",

Definite crowns were observed just under steep cliffs to rider's right of the Main Chute. The entire rider's left wall from mid slope down off the North Ridge had connected pockets as well. They all appeared to have run possibly overnight during the high PI rates on 20191128 into 20191129. Along with these observations, there had also been activity in the Toilet Bowl area as well as the V-Tree Area. No crowns were able to be observed safely, yet hard slab debris chunks were observed in the lower runout zones as well as covering the uphill sides of trees. Of Note: Numerous and widespread loud thundering collapses were observed while traveling on the low angle northerly side of the East Ridge of Pioneer. See other photo. Also of note, numerous collapses were observed on the low angle S and SE aspects off the East Ridge. There appeared to be a 3 cm layer of October facets with a 2 cm m/f crust capping it, and the collapsing slab consisted of 1 finger to pencil hard new snow that had been stiffened up by the upslope southerly winds.\n",

I intentionally triggered a soft slab in the very southernmost part of Toledo Bowl, from the peak in the chute that runs about 1000 vertical in a due east direction.  I was quite surprised by how far it ran, and I think if someone had been below me but out of sight this slide could have been a big problem for them.  I knew know one was there as I had put in the skin track to the peak.  I knew this chute was going to move but I was quite surprised how fast and how far it went.  I generally try not to be surprised in the backcountry, and I am mad when I get surprised.  I think this chute was far more windloaded and denser than I would have guessed from my previous runs in main and banana days on similar aspects.  I did have a very small soft slab release at the bottom of main days on a very steep (>45 degrees) aspect, but it was totally manageable and expected.  I think this slide surprised me because of how predictable things had been over in days fork.  I forgot my camera so there are no pics.  (first trip of the season, I was lucky I remembered the beacon).  It did pull out parts of the chute that were not directly in the slide path in a sort of sympathetic fashion.  The bed surface was pretty soft, not a hard suncrust.",

          "Comments 1": "This report is being submitted vicariously for another party, in case it is not reported directly. Wind was the story today in upper LCC. Though the wind was blowing out of the S/SW, most of the high terrain was subject to some combination of wind scouring and cross loading of hard wind slabs due to eddying and convective upcanyon winds meeting the upper level winds. My partner and I were headed for the coalpit headwall, but after climbing and skiing the Hogum Hobgack and looking up the Hypodermic Needle, we were not convinced topping out would be feasible. Snow whirls were eddying up the chute and snow was pluming off the top of the headwall. \"Let's head partway up and assess.\"\nAs we started up the bottom of the hypo, one party ahead of us head already topped out and another party was near the top. One quarter of way up the ascent, wind slab avalanche debris from a moderate sized slide came down the needle at us. My partner Mike made a quick move to ski down and out of the way. Shortly after, a party of 3 skied down to us. The first skier reported that even though the snow surface had seemed like bulletproof wind slab on the ascent, he had triggered a slightly softer wind slab on the descent on the skiers right (leeward side of cliffband). The slide carried him 300' and he went under at one point but ended up on top. The slide ran about 600' total and was not huge, but certainly enough to bury a person (pic 1).\nWe all decided to bail and head down Hogum Fork. On the way down, in the bottom of the drainage, I ski cut a small but steep rollover in otherwise benign terrain that released a wind slab up to 3' deep (pic 2).",

I give credit to my wife for noticing what I thought was an optical illusion (turned out to be the main crown line off Thurston Peak) otherwise we wouldn't have made this discovery! I'm unsure as to when the cycle happened but judging by the nature of the deposition piles that we could spot, I would place them in the wet slab or wet loose and cornice release and likely the middle to end of this last week during the rain event and or the green housing and warming. In our investigation we counted 10-15 crown lines that may be connected from ridge line to ridge line and the large majority were on the middle 2/3 of main ridge, initiating on the northerly & northwesterly aspects of the westerly running sub ridges. There are so many avalanches over such similar terrain and short piece of the range  I opted to lump these all in to one observation so to save some time.

          "Comments 1": "We went to investigate an avalanche that we spotted from afar. Guessing it occurred sometime between January 29th & 31st. There were many snowmobile tracks on the slope around so we are guessing it was snowmobile triggered. We turned our beacons to search and found no signal. This avalanche was interesting because it started sliding on a layer 55cm above the ground and then stepped down to the ground. The crown varied between 2 & 4 feet deep and filled the gully at the bottom completely. Wish we knew the whole story, hope everyone involved is okay. [Forecaster Comments: Thanks for submitting this observation. Always a good idea to do a beacon search when coming across fresh debris for a slide that hasn't yet been reported.]\n",

The avalanche was 300 ft wide 2-3 ft deep and ran pretty far taking out a few tracks from yesterday. \nNot sure if this avalanche was a natural or triggered remotely by the party that pushed the up track up the head wall early this morning. Possibly this was the party that was caught in a avalanche in West Porter area. This was not the avalanche that caught and buried someone one I think. The avalanche that I took a picture of might be the slide the party was caught in but, I searched the bed surface looking for tracks and also looked up at the crown and saw no tracks. However, this is all speculation on my part.",

In the forecast this morning Drew mentioned to be wise in terrain choices and the best tool for avoiding avalanches is to stay off slopes approaching 32 degrees and steeper. This up track went straight up the head wall on a slope that was easily steeper than 35 degrees and was loaded up with plenty of new snow.\nI also saw many other backcountry travelers punching lines steeper than 35 degrees and it was a miracle that only one person took a ride. SLOW DOWN PEOPLE. THE HILL WE BE THERE NEXT YEAR........ WILL YOU?\n I decided not to ski anything steeper than 30 degrees. ",

The rider was partially buried nearby and was able to self extricate.  A second rider rode his sled down the slope and assisted the first.\n\n\t \n\n\tAccording to information gathered from the father of the second rider, the avalanche was only a small part of the ordeal.   It turns out the pair had descended into a steep ravine that bottomed out in cliffs above the rock quarry at the head of the canyon.  They could not get down due to the cliffs below and they couldn't get back up the steep gully they had descended. \n\n\t \n\n\tTrapped by the terrain, the pair became exhausted recovering the sled and trying to get back up and out of the bottomless ravine. They called friends for help in the evening and eventually made it out of the canyon after a long night on the mountain...\n \n",

          "Comments 1": "Just to add to the reports from yesterday.  We found very sensitive new-snow slab conditions, with a density inversion the weak layer.  Weather was windy and snowing hard, just above freezing, with poor visibility.  On way up to Cardiff Pass two Alta Ski Patrolmen skied by, and told us that they had just triggered east-facing Cardiff Peak.  Continuing up, we passed a slide that was about 200 yards across, at a mid-slope rollover next to the trail, triggered by a skier.  When we got within sight, the Cardiff Peak slide was wall-to-wall.  These slides did not run very far over lower-angle terrain, nor pile up too deeply, but the snow was heavy and it would not have been fun to be caught by one of these, or end up in a gully (like the one under Toledo Bowl.)  From Cardiff Pass we saw that the east side of the ridge that separates East and West Cardiff had slid, we believe naturally, again wall-to-wall.  Two of us skied back to Alta, another two entered Cardiff Fork.  Later they told us that Cardiac Ridge had slid wall-to-wall, as well as another steep slope along the ridge between the weather station and LSB.  Sorry we got no photos, as light was very poor.",

          "Comments 1": "We started up Main Porter Fork. It was raining bellow about 7600'.    Lots of cornice building and wind loading on the ridge from Sox's to Ice Box.  We noted evidence of one natural avalanche from the ridge on a NE facing slope. We picked our way into Ice Box through low angle terrain.  Hand pits away from ridge line at 11:00 AM did not indicate propagation through the slab.  However ski cuts on a somewhat loaded test slope off of the ridge line produced a long running 12\" deep x 15' wide SS on the 4th ski cut.  \n\nWinds off the ridge line were variable and decreased in the afternoon.  We noted increasing PI throughout the day and the skinner was filling back in rapidly.  No collapsing or shooting cracks.  Hand pits showed increasing sensitivity and slab formation through the afternoon.  We picked our way up Main Porter Fork on low angle terrain to drop into West Porter Fork.  \n\nJust past the saddle with West Porter Fork person breaking trail initiated a kick turn to avoid a steeper open slope.  The slope collapsed and cracks shot out and propagated up the adjacent slope 100' above him.  The slab was about 10\" deep and 60' wide and slid right past his ski tips.  The slab ran with considerable energy about 300' down into small trees.  Measured slope of skin track where initiated was 33* (steeper than we thought).  Adjacent avalanche path was estimated at 35* steepening to 38*.   \n\nPhone was dead so no pictures.  \n",

Figured that the Key Hole would probably avalanche too, entered on skiers right and about 25ft off the ridge the slope fractured and propagated out about 30 or 40ft. The crown was from 10 to 12 inches in depth and the debris ran about 300-400ft. Not much of a surprise it pulled out, the clues were all there, recent avalanches, wind loading, and new snow not bonding well to the old surface.\n",

          "Comments 1": "I observed this avalanche in West Bowl on Saturday, 1/23/16, but I do not know exactly when it occurred.   The location is about half way between the top of West Bowl and Davenport Hill. It would appear to have been sometime between Thursday and Saturday.  Everything about this avalanche is my estimation, and could be incorrect.  However, I think it is important to have a record of it, as it looks like a \"repeater\".  It ran to the rocky ground in the upper starting zone, but the relatively small deposition suggests it wasn't the whole snowpack, so I infer that this path has run one or more times before and reloaded with wind deposition from the south side of the ridge.  The other interesting thing about this slide is how far visible crowns extend out and down the hill.  This is a very large area through which the fracture propagated, or triggered the other mid-slope avalanches sympathetically.  Either way, it speaks to the presence of weak snow underlying this particular area.  \n\nIt should be noted that if this area refills during the next storm or wind event, another avalanche is very likely.  \n\nIn the picture, I have outlined the visible crowns in red.\n",

Look to be skier triggered it had tracks around it and coming out of it. 10 inches at its deepest point and about 50ft wide, ran on the old snow surface from earlier in the week. The S-SW winds have been loading the N facing just down off the ridge line for a couple days now and it looks like someone found the sweet spot in this N facing chute. Looked big enough to carry you but not big enough to do any damage, could have been a different story in steep unforgiving terrain.

          "Comments 1": "On our drive up to Geyser Pass this morning (1/24) we observed what appeared to be a natural release and crown in lower Corkscrew Glades.  Through binoculars we were able to see that a large portion of the lowest open pocket (talus moraine) had slid.  At the end of the day we stopped to look through the binocs more and also observed an approximately 3-5 ft crown in one of the uppermost open pockets where we sometimes ski.  It was difficult to tell if the upper slide had propagated into areas of the loosely spaced trees below on a slope of around 35-40 degrees.\n\nIt's also worth noting that we observed several other natural releases on similar aspects and elevations in the Exxon's Folley and Gravel Pit Lanes areas.  The skier's left side of the Funnel is also loaded up with a visibly thick wind slab that looks very touchy.  Although Corkscrew is a tempting area in all of the new snow, I would steer clear until the snowpack has had plenty of time to settle and no additional loading.\n\nUnfortunately I do not have a good zoom lens that could capture an adequate photo of the slides, but if you look over toward Corkscrew on your drive up Geyser Pass road, you will see the crowns.\n\nStay safe out there!\n",

While observing a skier drop in on a more east facing shoot around 11:30 the skier took a hard tumble and a wet slide released after him traveling at least 400 ft. The skier was able to move away from the wet slide and other skiers eventually made there way down. Daytime warming especially in steep and rocky terrain make perfect wet slide conditions.",

          "Comments 1": "Wanted to scout new lines for after the storm and when stability was more consistent.  Approached area cautiously as it could have been forming cornice.  New area - so unknown.  Probed and patted as I came near edge for possible cornice concerns.  Group was not exposed - only I was.  Was able to safely make way out to evaluate conditions and possible future lines.  Spent a few minutes observing lines and weather while looking for safest selection of terrain for a splitboard/AT skin track route that would take us back to the top of the ridge after the decent for future ski.  Could not see cornice - except for formations of a few further down the ridge.  Walked back to safe zone to grab camera and give findings to group.  Went back out on same book pack still cautiously for another look.  While beginning to leave - massive propagation stretched the entire east facing ridge (looking out towards Fairview Lakes). Propagation connected to a SE facing ridge and set off slide of entire aspect.  I am still hesitant to say it was 100% cornice as everything acted in slab nature, but logic tells me slight cornice formation maybe on top of unstable slope causing slab like nature to cornice area.  Smaller propagation covered the entire face below me.  Had group throw my cornice cutting rope to me as I was surrounded by huge cracks and was afraid to move - tied back in and pulled to safety.  Earlier that day: Spent the previous hours digging pits and beacon practices before this event.  Found CT 14s scattered around and CT 23's.  Also found a few CT 3's and 12s where winds were blowing.  All CTs were on east facing slopes.  Did note that we were getting very different readings all over east facing slopes - pending on wind exposure. .   Glad to ski another day.  Hope this can help others in the Sanpete area.  -Sean Busby",

I’m going with persistent weak layer because it instantly stepped down to the facets at the ground. I only inspected the slide lower on the slope and it initially started in a thin rocky steep area where the crown was only a foot deep, but it pulled out to the ground leaving a 2 foot crown in the deepest part. The new snow cleaned out and ran a good ways on the flats but it left the 5 to 8 inches of faceted snow in the bed surface. Conditions were full on at this point and I didn’t inspect the slide off the peak.  No one was in the area, and only took a small disturbance on the slope to produce remotely triggered avalanches\n",

It broke about 50' above me and luckily the slab stayed together long enough for me to ski 30' or so off of it while it was moving. The crown didn't look that large but the size and power of the debris makes me think it was at least 18-24\" deep in some places. It ran 300-400' vertical feet. I think I'm lucky to have skied off it and that my partner wasn't caught, since in hindsight we weren't spaced out as far as we should have been. We should have had our guard up more today given all of the strong winds from various directions over the last several days. \n",

I found a pencil to one finger hard layer that formed during the beginning of the last storm cycle.  On top of that was a one finger hard wind slab and what appeared and felt like small grained facets between the wet and cold layers however I didn't take pics of crystals to verify.  This was all new wind slab and no old snow pulled out.  Just a few feet away from the slide, and off the slab, I found blower light power on top of our rain /wet snow layer that formed at the beginning of the last storm.  Unrelated to the slide, I found noticeable basal facets up to 8 cm thick at the ground interface.\n\nAdded Notes:  I ran into a group and they asked me when the slide occurred before I had skied it.  I didn't see any evidence of a slide or crown at that point but the light was a little flat at that point and they had come form another vantage point than myself.  I did notice that on Friday someone had put an up track in the middle of the slope adjacent to the slide within 100 feet of the skiers right flank.  Also when investigating, I noticed part of the crown closer to the skin track was filled in more than I suspected.  I even dug around a little to see how fresh the snow was below the crown and judging by the density of the new blown in snow it seemed like that section of the crown could have been from day before.  I suspect the skinner remote triggered the slide just as I did at the bottom of my run.  Looking at the very last pick we see the second slide pulled even closer to the skin track.  The swatch of the slope was clean where I had skied and as you can see in the second to last pic the runout is centered on my tracks.\n",

We skied the west face of Patsey Marley below the microwave tower back into Alta. About half way down we put in a ski cut on top of the steep rollover. Based on what we'd seen with our test slopes we figured it would probably go. The slab consisted of new snow only, didn't run with too much energy, and was completely manageable. Poor vis made for a poor photo. We did call Alta Central, as the sun had peeked out by the time we got back to the car and you could see the slide from the parking lot.",

Climber's left had only weak snow, no slab. As the first skinner moved up and right to gain the ridge, he collapsed the newly formed wind slab (in the lee of the north/northwest ridge) above the faceted grains and it pulled out 10' above him. \nNever caught how far he was carried, but he relayed that he was wrapped around a tree, lost a ski and suffered two broken ribs and a fractured tibial plateau. The two were able to self-evac with significant self-reliance and suffering. \nBy the individual caught, carried and injured - \n\"A bit of a rough ride after triggering a slide on the up track nearing the top of Mt Aire. Thankfully aside from some injuries all is well. The failure occurred on the new snow/old snow interface with wind loading being the culprit of the new snow. Even though the majority of the loading was happening on the south facing slopes enough had loaded to from a 6\" slab that broke free about 10 feet above me. The fracture followed the ridge down for an undetermined distance. Just goes to show to that even some loading with no new snow can get things moving especially on solid crust.

Hard slabs have the propensity to pull out above you when you've perhaps collapsed a thinner part of the slab onto the failure plane below. This seems to have been the case as the two were skinning up the slope and moving into the thinner part of the 'lens' of hard slab. Heading up and into the slab, having it break above you, and skinning doesn't give you much of a chance to escape. Fortunately, the two were spread out enough so that only one was caught. ",

It wasn't until we got closer to the site that we realized just how big this avalanche was. The terrain isn't extreme, slope angles average 35 degrees, though there is a 37 degree mid slope breakover. The scary deal here is the slide pulled snow out along a low angle ridge which only measured 22 degrees in slope angle. In addition to this large avalanche, you can see another pocket in the foreground which broke sympathetically.

The Glide avalanche came of the rock shield about 3\\4 of the way up Bonkers an on the skiers left side while ascending. Debris ran down to where the slope flattens out.

I'm curious if anyone has any information about the slide, or if it was a natural.  I thought this would be a helpful addition to the last week of persistent slabs we've been having.  You can see in the pictures it started right below the Sundial, and continued almost to the base of the gully just a couple hundred feet above the height of the lake.\nForecaster Comments: Added date of 1 Feb to keep it within the queue...overall date of release unknown.\n",

The timing is uncertain. \n\n\n\nArm chair observation from the office in downtown Orem. Spotted this with the naked eye in the late afternoon (first photo). Photo is taken with a phone up to a binocular scope. I am guessing it started as a wet slide that then stepped down to a weak layer and then broke across the slope about a quarter mile wide. Estimating at least 5ft deep based off of how easy it is to spot. On the ridgeline just south of the north summit of Timp. Also saw some other wet slides on the south end of timp off of the cliffs (second photo). Similar wet slides also observed on the south end of Cascade (SW facing aspects) earlier this weekend. So it could be that the massive slide broke off a couple days ago.\n",

My best guess is Sunday when the sun came out.  The debris had no new snow on it.  The debris pile was quite large and the storm slab had pulled out all the old snow most of the way down.  The debris was very close to the summer trail at the bottom and if caught would certainly have buried and possibly killed someone as they got drug over the ground surface.  This was an eye opener and was an obvious indicator to stay off steep south facing wind effected slopes.\nI dug a pit higher up the drainage below Manns at about 11,800 just below the tree line facing south.  New snow depth was about 10 inches.  HS 160 CTN, moderate shovel sheer pulled out about 2 feet of snow on a very thin weak layer ( 1 cm thick ) of buried near surface facets.\nThe snow has filled in very nicely in the La Sals (180 cm in sheltered terrain) however much of the alpine has been scoured clean, the tree line and lower is deep and quality is very high.  I expect the sun to have it's way with the snow today and begin our first corn cycle.  I expect the steep south slopes to off limits mid-day as the sun bakes the snow into wet mush.\n",

Elevation: 9277'\nSlope Angle in Gully: 37 deg. \n\nAspect: 182 deg. \n\nGully off of Binx's Ridge, LCC\n\n\nMyself, Sean T., and two friends were skiing Emma Ridge / Binx's Ridge on the afternoon of  12.27.2021. We had discussed the dangers of wind loading, wind slabs, and wind pockets before starting out. We observed a relatively stable snow pack on the approach, except for a few quick pole punch tests where we observed a quickly accumulating wind slab on some slopes. We reached the ridge in about 35 minutes, and immediately noticed large cornicing and wind loading on top of the ridge line. We again discussed the dangers of wind-loading, skiing leeward slopes, terrain traps, and proceeded with caution. We transitioned at the top of Emma Ridge (10200 elev.) and the first skier dropped onto the slope. Giving each other adequate and safe space, we each dropped the slope. At aprox. 15:23 the first skier remotely triggered a wind slab that had accumulated in a gully off of the ridge, which is well known for sliding. This terrain trap was identified by all members of the party. When the entire team reached the island of safety, established by the first skier, the first skier stated how he had skied up to the edge of the gully, watched shooting cracks propagate beneath him, and immediately skied away. The second and third skiers identified the approximate depth of the slab to be between 16\"-20\".\n\n \n\nAll members of the party made it off the mountain safely and without incident. \n\nBC skiers be warned! Emma and Binx's ridges are relatively safe, considering the snow pack, but there are many terrain traps surrounding those areas. Proceed with caution, be aware on the uphill and downhill, and do not be folly to the potential wind slabs that are accumulating through the rest of this storm cycle. High winds and heavy snow fall are contributing to these dangerous conditions. \n",

          "Comments 1": "After a friend and I had climbed this hill about ten different times my friend placed a track about ten feet above our last highmark.  He sidehilled across the slope and was just about to turn downhill when the avalanche broke loose.  At that moment my friend made a quick last minute decision and turned his sled uphill and got stuck right where the crown broke.  The crown face was between 2' and 3' and it appeared to be a pillow of wind loaded snow that ran on the rain crust.  In the picture you can see previous tracks we placed on left side of the field.  The track going through the middle of the debris pile is from my friend descending after he dug his sled out.\n\nWe also observed another slide later in the day.  Earlier I drop off a cornice \ninto a chute of sorts with nothing more than some loose snow sluffing.  Later we \ntraveled along that ridge and as we passed the same place I went off earlier a \npiece of cornice broke off and triggered an avalanche.  The aspect was very \nsimiliar to the one I reported, but maybe a little smaller of a slide.  Here are \nthe coordinates I got off google maps, I am not sure the \nformat 40.548961-111.568394 (it is west and slightly north of the slide I \nreported)\nThanks to you and all the of the forecaster, you all do a great job.  I read the \nreport just about everyday and try to pick my routes or the hills we may climb \naccordingly. \n\n ",
          "Comments 2": "There was one portion of the slide that did break through the January rain crust which was quite stout and about 1 inch thick. This was on the lookers right side of the slide where the avalanche fractured in the trees. Faceted snow below the crust was the weakness. You can see the facets and the crust a few inches above the bed surface in this photo. The facets were not particularly alarming and it was difficult to reproduce shears with tests here. This portion of the slope was 48 degrees in steepness.",
          "Comments 3": "Here is the other pocket that Mr Miller reported. It was on the north aspect of the main Ant Knolls. I did not climb down in to check it out. The stout crust not too far under the surface was too intimidating for me to get on this very steep terrain.",
          "Comments 4": "Forecaster Comments:\nKobernik\nThis was a significant avalanche. Mr Miller's assessment was correct in my opinion. It was a recent windload which failed just above the January rain crust. There was no significant weakness directly above the crust. It was difficult to get this weakness to fail in shear tests. The rapid addition of weight from the wind transported snow seemed to be the biggest factor. I suspect that if this slope were left alone for another 24 hours to give the fresh wind load a little more time to settle it probably wouldn't have avalanched.\nI tip my hat to these guys for checking out the crown and trying to figure out what was going on with the layering. Our sled community is becoming more savvy as the years go on and it's great to see!!",

          "Comments 1": "While hiking the Broads Fork trail I noted several avalanches that had occurred off the east facing slopes.  As you know, these areas commonly run throughout the winter and this year was no exception.  As I hiked further, this large slide came into my view. It had entrained a significant amount of snow and was easily several hundred yards wide at its terminus.  The avalanche was also choked with large chunks of ice/snow and was perhaps 6-7 feet deep in most spots w/some areas up to 10 feet deep further up the avy's path.  The avalanche date of May 5th is an estimate but seemed to match reasonably well with the snows appearance and previous weather conditions...although could have been w/in the past two weeks.  The pics below show the slides full path and also looking up/across the avalanches impressive mass. \n\nForecasters note: from looking at the photos, the avalanche could be more recent than May 5.  It could have occurred during the very warm period on Monday or Tuesday the 13th or 14th.  With these glide avalanches it's hard to tell since they come down quite randomly.   Tremper",

          "Comments 1": "Early this morning I triggered a deep wind slab off the NE face of Lone Peak. In hindsight it is incredibly obvious that we had no business being there, but I will list out thoughts and details below.\n\n \n\nBack in February my partner and I planned a linkup connecting Alpine to BCC. We discussed logistics and had the details ironed out, however we never ended up completing it. Fast forward to last weekend- I saw a favorable forecast with lower temps and reached out to my partner. We decided that this would be our last chance of the season to complete this objective, so we planned accordingly.  At this time forecasts predicted 1-2\" of snow at upper elevations with moderate winds. We decided that this wouldn't be too large of a factor but we would need to be heads up for wind slabs as always. \n\n \n\nOver the course of the week, the forecast was upgraded to predict strong NW winds and up to 14\" of snow at 10,000. We discussed this at length and decided to make a game time decision- if more than 6\" of snow or sustained winds over 30 were reported by 1930 4/21, we would bail. Come yesterday evening winds of 30mph and 5\" of snow were reported. Despite this being very close to the cutoff we has discussed, we decided to continue ahead.\n\n \n\nWe began from Alpine this morning and summitted Lone Peak at 0530. It was dark, very windy and a cloud sat on the upper ~700 feet of the mountain limiting visibility to less than 10 feet. We immediately bailed on the NE couloir and skied down the ridge a few hundred feet to escape the high gusts. At this point we decided to ski a small chute that drops into upper bells so we could continue with the rest of our linkup. We planned to ski this chute relatively close to one another given the low visibility. I skied first and found what looked to be a meager island on the skiers right side of the chute. I gave the okay for my partner to ski skiers left then make his way over to me. As he got within 5 feet of me, a wind slab broke 3-4' deep at his feet and carried me. I was immediately knocked off my feet but was able to arrest after 50-75 feet. We skied the path down and decided to bail.\n\n \n\nI think that the largest error I made was feeling \"safe\" after bailing on our objective, NE Lone. We decided that it was inherently too risky, however what we ended up skiing was really no different. While it didn't have the exposed entrance and exit, it was the same aspect, elevation and certainly steep enough to avalanche. \n\n \n\nThe wind slab that failed was not apparent. It is not surprising that one had developed, however I did not expect it to connect so deep given the low storm totals. This was another error. I grossly underestimated wind loading potential.\n\n \n\nThe last contributing downfall was my objective-oriented decision making. I knew that this was likely the last opportunity for this goal this season and it affected my decision making. I let plans supersede safe decisions.\n\n \n\nGiven the combination of darkness, poor visibility, high winds + new snow, the right decision was to ski back to the car and get breakfast. I  was incredibly humbled, and am grateful to be physically uninjured.\n",

          "Comments 1": "Out for a nice christmas day tour with a group of four.  Skied an excellent lap of hero-snow in East-Bowl, then headed up West-Bowl to poke into Hideaway Park.  We dug a pit in the top of Hideaway Park and received mixed signals from the snowpack after three compression tests and three extended column tests.  We recognized our weak layer as well developed facets (mid-november cold snap NSF) ~30cm from the surface with a well-bonded slab (made up of the pre-christmas rime/snow/graupel events) above it.  We decided that we felt safe moving along the lower-angle shoulder, expected the possibility of manageable avalanching, and ensured there was no one below before ski-cutting our shoulder.  After a few cuts and during some safe-spot to safe-spot skiing one of our skiers (third to ski the slope) triggered and skied off a pocket on the more westerly slope of the shoulder that popped ~50' wide x18\" deep and ran ~200' downslope.  I then skied (safe-spot to safe-spot) the shoulder's more northern and mellow slope and triggered a larger pocket that popped ~50' wide x 18\" deep and ran ~600' (full track).  The second slide sympathetically released a small pocket in the trees next to it as it moved slowly down slope.  Both ran near the ground on old November facets (buried deep) and left evidence in their bed surface of the buried dirt layer from earlier this fall.  No one was caught in either slide and our party felt confident with the decisions we had made and the results of our actions.  We recognized that the avalanches had re-confirmed our assumptions about our mixed pit findings as well as the persistent slab problem we are experiencing in the Wasatch.",

Thinking maybe a natural from the period of North winds during the last storm. Guessing based on my pit today that the failure was on the interface of the heavy wet snow and the drier snow from after the cold front passage on Friday, or possibly some NSF from prior to the storm. Tough to really tell from across the way. Graupel seemed to be a player in the failure planes in my pit. This slide released directly underneath the White Cliffs and took out all of Martha's Bowl underneath Double Dogleg, running down into the choke above the lake.

He was dead when rescue crews got to him. Weather conditions, including wind gusts up to 75 mph, prevented efforts to remove the body. Crews left markers and will attempt to remove the body Sunday if conditions improve.\n\n \n\nSuzanne Tremblay, also in her 20s, was seriously injured in the slide, Salt Lake County Sheriff's Lt. Steven Chard said. She was in stable condition at Alta View Hospital late Saturday.\n\n\"She's doing OK,\" a nursing supervisor said. \"We just want to watch her for 12 to 24 hours to make sure.\"\n\n \n\nThe two were snowboarding with two other men and a woman when the avalanche started about 12:30 p.m., Chard said. The group was descending Mount Baldy at Snowbird when about 500 vertical feet of snow broke loose and swept up the snow-boarders as the avalanche rushed down the mountain of cliffs and exposed rocks.\n\n \n\nThe falling snow \"It was awfully lucky for any of them to survive,\" Sheriff's Lt. Lane Larkin said.\n\n \n\nTwo of the snowboarders were not completely buried and were able to dig themselves free, Larkin said. They made it to a lodge at Snowbird and called for help.\n\n \n\nThe other snowboarders were identified as Justin E. Kihell, Sean Mceeigh and Nicole Auletta. The five apparently moved to Utah from the East Coast about a month ago, authorities said.\n\n \n\nThe snowboarders started out at the Alta ski resort and made their way to Snowbird. The group ignored no trespassing signs and posted warnings of avalanche danger as they hiked into Snowbird, Chard said.\n\n \n\nNeither resort is open, so no avalanche control has been done. Authorities are urging recreationists to stay away from the slopes - calling conditions \"extremely dangerous\" - until the resorts open.\n\n\n ",

Jeff Clement, 21, was snowboarding with four friends in Little Cottonwood Canyon, between the Alta and Snowbird ski areas, when the incident occurred.\n\n\"It was reported that he was the last to start down and he's the one who broke it loose,\" Captain Gil Howard, of the Salt Lake Country Sheriff's Office, said. \"It was a way unstable area.\n\n\n\n\"The problem was they were in a ski area, but they were faced with backcountry conditions...\"\n— Sgt. Gil Howard, Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office\n\n\n\n \n\n\"All five were buried to one extent or another,\" Howard said, \"and he was the only one completely buried.\" The other four were able to extract themselves, but Clement was buried with his board uphill. Carrying no beacons or shovels, the friends reportedly did everything they could to locate Clement but were unsuccessful.\n\n \n\nClement's body was found at approximately 2 p.m. Saturday by an Alta rescue dog, but a heavy storm predicted for the area Saturday night forced rescuers to abandon the recovery effort.\n\nReturning Sunday during snows, rescuers \"shocked the mountain\" to release unstable snow and safely removed the body. Clement was originally buried under three feet of snow. Though not officially determined, Howard said, it appeared Clement may have died from severe head trauma\n\n \n\n\"The problem was they were in a ski area, but they were faced with backcountry conditions. They are lulled into a false sense, but there's no control work done and this is the tragic outcome,\" Howard said. Howard said he has heard there were upwards of 50 people in the area that day. Clement and his friends 'were just in the wrong area on the wrong day and at the wrong time,\" he said.\n\n \n\nA female member of the group was transported to Alta View hospital after the accident but has since been released. The other three snowboarders were not seriously injured.\n\nHoward said the five friends had hiked the ridgeline from Alta ski area onto Mt. Baldy. Not yet open for the season, the upper mountain, Howard said, is a popular pre-season destination for adventurous skiers and snowboarders. But, without any controls yet done on the mountain, avalanche danger was extremely high and the fact that the area is closed is well posted.\n\n \n\n\"They had to hike quite a bit to get up there,\" Howard said, \"but it's not atypical. It's a hard way to learn, but if we can prevent it from happening again, then there's a small amount of good that comes from it.\" Howard said it is imperative people learn about snow conditions and snow safety, as well as carry emergency equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Snowy Torrents narrative below has been provided courtesy of the American Avalanche Association.

Of course, I'm trying to focus on my driving, but I see something unusual in the corner of my eye on the PC ridgeline that looks like a wet slab. Sure enough... it appears like a decent piece of snow peeled off the Squaretop rock slabs sometime in the past 24 hours. I gave PCMR Snow Safety Director Andy Van Houten a quick heads up and he snapped the image embedded in this ob. Not a particularly unusual event for the terrain or time of year. Like most us.... Squaretop is shedding its winter coat.\n",

          "Comments 1": "I arrived at Rock Canyon Campground around noon on Sunday.  I heard a couple of short slide rushes just before 1pm.  I assumed they were\nto the East up Dry Fork.  At 1:25 there was an extended sound with boulders included.  At 1:35 there was a second long one.  Location and altitude are estimated based on direct and reflected sound, and position of the sun.\n\nI could see a limited number of fresh point release/small rollers & a single short avalanche with minimal entrainment in Burnt Hollow around 8200'.\n\nIt felt like 45 degrees and I assume that all of these were influenced by local terrain greenhouse effects.\n\nShortly after I arrived at the campground there was a rocky sounding slide due North of the campground.  It was one of the Crowsfoot Couloirs dumping mostly rock.  No-mans-land, but interesting because there is so little snow on the southerly facing aspects.",

Aspen scrub is still prominent on the lower approaches.   There is limited leeward drifting on the west-aspect ridges.  Although one area around 9000' had released a small patch,  probably with Saturday's afternoon heating.  There was some wind-scouring to the ground at about 9800' on West Provo Ridge.\n\nThere were a couple of large rollers next to the trail just North of Second Right Hand Fork Overlook.  They predated the last snowstorm.  West \naspect, 6700'.  Due South there is an open area that is mostly Northwest Aspect that had a lot of rollers from both Saturday & Sunday.  Both these locations are already getting more afternoon sun and heating.",

          "Comments 1": "While it was a small avalanche that was I caught in and it did not even move me downhill, I'd like to identify the mistakes clearly made which caused this result. Partner bailed but still went out today with the intent of exploring around Catherine's Pass just to take a look and take one ride out using the low angle terrain near the trail to the pass to get back down to the meadow. Started at 12:30 and got to the pass at 3:00. Since it stopped snowing and began to clear, decided to skin up to the ridgeline for a better view.  Dug 3 pits, one prior in the meadow just for curiosity’s sake, another along the ridge and another towards what I believed to be the top of the run ‘so long’.  After these assessments, it was apparent riding any of these open slopes could be a bad play. By the time I was at what I perceived to be ‘so long’ it was snowing pretty well again and the fatigue that had set in had begun to cloud my judgment. Instead of taking the time to simply use my own skin track back to the meadow, figured I could save time and energy by riding or just hiking down the spine. (Looker’s right of 'so long' utilizing all the trees as anchors.) \n\nAs I started down, I didn’t locate the specific trees I had seen several times before and then realized I was not near so long but actually on sunset, which starts out at even lower angle but has a short, steep section for what I believe was about 20-30 yards to get to the meadow. Attempted 3 turns to release any sluff which it did and released a good bit of snow to my right. So had let that pass and attempted to change direction to exit to my left by crossing the slope and once I did, it released about 5 or so yards above me and was easily able to stop and let the snow pass without issue. \n\nTook only one photo which is attached and surprised how far it had continued to my left. Again, a bad estimate on distance but would guess 60-80 yards? Rode down to the meadow and out but think about the following mistakes. (1) Should have never been on that north facing slope, especially being well aware of the advisory and previous snow still in place, (2) solo, (3) deviated from original plan, (4) used fatigue and time constraints as an excuse to not backtrack safely, (5) knowingly going into a short, but potential terrain trap, (6) changing direction after releasing the sluff. \n\nThought it was important to report and get the appropriate feedback. \n\nForecaster Comments:  Excellent perspective on the event.  Thank you for submitting the observation.  Should inspire others heading out over the weekend that avalanche season has begun.",

          "Comments 1": "No big surprise here, given last night's excellent storm and the previous ground cover conditions. I observed this slide at about 1:30 PM while walking the ridge east from the top of Flagstaff, and it appeared to have been triggered remotely by the only other skier to traverse the ridge before me. The skier's broken trail was not connected to any portion of the crown, but the crown and bed surface looked pretty fresh, with just a touch of wind deposited graupel on top. The crown of the slide is at least 10 feet below the ridge on the north side, and in many places it is more than 50 feet down the north side. The slide extends from Oingo Boingo on the east several hundred feet over toward Two Dogs, although I do not believe it took out Two Dogs or the adjacent terrain east of Two Dogs. I did not get close enough to the crown to check it out, but it appears as though the slide took out the entire snowpack in this area. Bad visibility and no access to a good vantage point, so no photos. I suppose this slide could have been natural but given how fresh it looked I assume it was triggered by the other skier, perhaps unknowingly...",
          "Comments 2": "I enjoyed a few runs on south facing LCC beginning around 11 AM and found the storm snow to be mostly held in place by the shape of the summer surface. I found decomposing melt-freeze crust underneath the storm snow at all elevations in these locations, and I did not find the new snow to exhibit siginificant fracturing properties in these locations--generally right side up and very, um, powdery. It didn't look like anybody ventured into West Bowl of Silver or Days today. I did not notice any obvious collapsing today, although I did my darn'dest to stay on S facing (having learned a lesson last winter). I hesitate to recommend the skiing due to the range of hazards present, but the snow quality is quite high. ",

          "Comments 4": "During a very brief window of sunshine at about 11:30 AM, I also observed what appeared to be a natural avalanche in East Hellgate, in a due east or slightly NE facing cup-shaped feature above the skiers traverse from Cardiff Bowl to the East Hellgate ski run. The slide appeared to be very fresh when I saw it. I did not see any skiers or tracks in the area, and the starting zone is overhung by steep rocky features, making it subject to enhanced wind-loading and an obvious place to harbor weak snow. From Flagstaff shoulder, the slide appeared to be about 50 feet wide and over a foot deep. I would do a separate observation for this but now it sounds like there has been some other funny business in the area, perhaps the involved party has better info on this E Hellgate Slide. At the time I noticed the E Hellgate slide, there was no other slide visible on S/E facing Cardiff...",

The most notable was a very large, full-path slide in the Z Gully on the N side of Cherry Peak. \n\nThe debris pile was massive ( the pictures don't do it justice). \n\nWe observed numerous wet loose avalanches on all aspects in the drainage as well as evidence of larger slides from earlier in the season. Deposition fields were very widespread with broken trees and debris scattered over the\n\nentire basin. \n\n \n\nNote: The ski out took work. The high snow levels made it impossible to find the summer trail and the warm snow was extra sticky, Navigation was unfun. We were lucky that the creek wasn't running higher because we had to cross (skis off) multiple times over sketchy snow bridges. All of the side creeks are running as well. We basically walked out about 7-8 miles. If you are thinking about heading out this way, I'd say don't. The water levels are only going to rise and make the creek crossings VERY dangerous if not impossible. Hiking back up to Naomi/TG is the safest option. \n",

          "Comments 1": "Watched a party of 4 drop into Stairs Gulch, dropped in myself a few minutes later. Pulled out a few small, manageable winds slabs as I descended, then encountered a much more substantial variety set off by the party ahead of me. The clue here was the solitary track ON the debris, three sets of erased tracks, and no other tracks in Stairs. Hopefully someone from this group can shed more light on the experience, though I snapped a fast pic (so fast the shutter apparently didn't open entirely..) which pretty well sums it up. Debris ran over a near vertical pitch of blue ice, and some hundred plus feet beyond. There is a substantial debris pile beneath the pinch that the eagle eyed may notice; however, most of that is from a large release off the east facing upper wall days prior.\n\nThere has also been substantial recent shedding in Stairs, the other photo displays some of this.",

          "Comments 1": "We came upon this slide on Sunday 1/10, but it was obvious that it was at least a day or two old, if not older. It was a prime example of the avalanche problem of this season - a slab failing on the old faceted snow. The avalanche broke from just off the ridge and ran until the bench below the upper gladed headwall. The slide exposed the rocks and earth below the bed surface. It took out trees that appeared to be 12 inches in diameter. While this wasn't a huge slide, it would certainly have been a very painful if not deadly ride. There were maybe four sets of tracks altogether in E. Mineral, and it looked like some might have skied down the slide path. Perhaps they triggered it from the ridge? \n\n \n\nWe observed this slide first from the ridge between Georges and Mid Ivory during our approach. These steep trees were our area of concern of the day and seeing the avalanche reinforced the point that steep shady terrain is off limits. We proceeded down our run with caution and gave steep roll overs a wide berth. There were no other noted signs of instability, besides a poor snow structure observed via pole pen. \n",

She went first, made two turns, looked like it would just slough but then saw the slope fracture above her. It didn't have a lot of energy and as she stopped it easily went past her and the tree she was up against without any issue. Still, we were a little surprised at how sensitive it was and how cleanly it slid. We had not noticed any cracking while skinning up, although there had been recent activity higher above our location I the very steep terrain. This particular feature we were on was also fairly steep and prone to wind loading",

The explosive triggered slide mentioned above is a N-NW  aspect off Millicent Peak above Twin Lake. This area recieives alot of wind and did not hold snow until mid Jan. The shot landed in thin rocky area and propagated deeper from there. This was the only event into old snow for our teams today. Today was the first time in a while that control results were negative and/or isolated to new snow.\nHowever by noon we had receive report of a unintentional user triggered slide off Pioneer Ridge above Dog Lake. Reported as 12-36 \" deep 400 wide. We have not seen natural activity in this area since before this weeks storm. This area has seen substaintial traffic this week. As I write this I am receiving report of yet another human triggered slide West of the first off Pioneer Ridge 3' deep 20' wide pushing user into trees. Perhaps the weight of a human is tipping the scales.\nJust a note-  Aspect and elevation of these 3 slopes is almost identical\nForecaster note (Bruce Tremper):\nI was returning from looking at the Tuscaroroa slide when I heard about the Pioneer slide and I went to the toe of the debris to look at it.  While I was digging in the snow, a lone skier descended from above and said that he triggered an avalanche to the west of the avalanche I was looking at.  He said it was 3' deep and 20' wide and it pushed him into a tree but he was OK.  Very lucky!",

This was a natural that released sometime around noon on the 24th, between our first and second runs in the area. The picture shows a well defined crown in a wind loaded portion at the top of the chute. We did not go examine the crown, but it was likely around 6-12\", the slide was shallow and new snow only. It ran approximately 400 vertical feet. The second avalanche occurred sometime on the 23rd, based on a little new snow on top of the debris, in the East Bowl of Silver Fork. The photo shows the debris pile. There were some old tracks from the previous day still visible along the side of the avalanche. Its hard to know whether there were other tracks that were covered by the slide, or not, and we could not determine where the top of the slide was located, but it seems to have originated up in the rocks at the top of the bowl.",

After an extended dry spell, 12\"-20\" of snow accompanied by mod-strong SW winds placed a significant load on a shallow and fragile snowpack. Did not get close enough to observe the crown but snowpits dug that day, and up to this point throughout the season, revealed a stratified and faceted snowpack, with the primary layer of concern being a weak layer of loose facets from early November storms sitting on top of a faceted, knife hard, melt-freeze layer formed in late October. We also observed a weak layer higher up in the snowpack that failed with a score of ECTP18, and this could also be the culprit, but due to widespread sensitivity and collapsing on the deeper, faceted layer above the crust at 35 cm, I'm inclined to believe that is the weak layer involved here. \n\n\n",

Our party was moving north from West Bowl in Silver Fork towards Upper Meadow Chutes. A solo skier passed us, we all grouped up above Doug's Drop. The solo skier (name unknown) geared up and took off without telling us where he planned to ski. After we talked as a group, we made our way north again and before dropping into Meadow Chutes, we noticed the solo skier's tracks going northwest into Day's Fork. I looked over the ridge and onto the slope, to find it had ripped to the ground and there was heavy debris piled into trees, with no clear ski tracks exiting the slide area. I began screaming downhill and heard the solo skiers voice say he was OK and not to ski down above him. Scary as hell, could have been a very different story. Heavily treed, northwest slope into Day's Fork between Doug's Drop and Upper Meadow Chutes.",

The initial release was a small wind slab at the ridge, and when it traveled down slope it released this larger pocket, failing on a graupel layer. This type of avalanche was ubiquitous around the range on many aspects above 8500'. There was evidence of another similar slide up higher in the drainage just below the headwall on the east facing slopes of the East Twin in Mary Ellen Gulch. This slide was remote triggered over 300m away due to mitigation work in the neighboring drainage of Mineral Basin (48 hours prior). There was also buried debris all throughout the drainage. The natural cycle, and ensuing AE and AS triggered avalanches during and following the week's storm is impressive. A truly widespread problem in the technical sense of the word.\n\nPhotos:\n\n1. Sinners SE Profile and Avalanche SS-ASc-R2D1.5-I\n\n2. Same slide different angle.\n\n3. Upper Mary Ellen Gulch SS-ABr-R3D1.5-I. There is also buried debris visible in the upper Silver Creek bowl and the Outhouse Chutes.\n\n4. Y Not Butress SS-AE-R2-D2-I. Released smaller pocket low on slope below convex roll. (Started from top of buttress. There are shot holes visible adjacent to avalanche path- assume explosive triggered from Heli work).

          "Comments 1": "My partner and I found ourselves climbing Reynolds peak via its northern ridge (from Dog Lake). The avalanche ripped from a northeastern pocket on the ridge line immediately north of an aspen glade which ran from the ridge to the bottom of the apron. When we investigated, we began to appreciate the slide's severity. Reaching a depth of ~4ft in locations and stretching for ~300 ft, it was immense. We noted that the avalanche failed on the PWL and propagated for at least a third of Reynolds' east face. After wrapping around towards the south and then back towards dog lake, we observed that the avalanche debris cascaded until ~8900 ft, removing a few small trees and branches. On the ridge, there was a western/southwestern wind which contributed to small cornices around the east face. However, my partner and I struggled to produce any collapses. We found no evidence of skiers or animals, thus it is likely that the avalanche was caused by the heavy snowfall/naturally, which was our first assumption. The visibility was rather poor today, and my phone camera was similar to if I had dropped it in a bucket of water, so apologies in advance if the pictures are unhelpful. For those of you touring in Mill D, this slide should be visible for those that hike beyond the reaches of Tom's Hill. Best of luck this weekend. \n",

Pits in the general vicinity indicated that a Rime Crust was formed sometime around Tuesday/Wednesday and this is now buried 10 inches down. Very Easy to Easy, Q1, SP Shears were observed directly below this Rime Crust. The slide appeared to initiate on .5mm facets below this Rime Crust. Another Easy to Moderate Q1, SP Shear was also noted 15 inches below the Rime Crust Shear. After the initial failure below the Rime Crust there appeared to be a step down in the other previously cited weak layer. Then as it descended down hill it rolled over a steep Convex feature that was a rock slab with slope angles > 45 degrees. At this point the slide stepped down for the second time and caused the failure into Basal Facets. This part of the slide appeared to be 6 to 8 feet deep. The entire slide propagated at least 300 feet wide with the deep failure confined to the steep Chutes directly below the Peak. The initial slide started approximately 125 feet below the Peak. Size of the slide appeared to be D 2.5.\n\nPicture not the greatest due to the limited visibility. \n\nSustained Moderate to Strong Winds out of the WNW began blowing around 1045 and Transport was Intense. Blowing Snow was observed well off the Peaks and getting down into the Mid Elevations at and below Tree Line.\n",

I have been riding sleds in this particular area since I was 8 years old. I am very familiar with the area. My brother and I were playing on the side of a hill in the a tree area where have have ridden 30-40 times in years past.. (Right side of the video). We had 3 other friends and one younger below in the flats. As I finished recording my brother playing in the pow, the mountain shook. My original thought was... earthquake. Than it it me, avalanche. As I turned and looked up I could see the snow wave coming. My brothers back was turned and I screamed avalanche as loud as I could. Now here comes my mistake #1. I pulled my klim avalanche backpack and boom, nothing happened. I hadn’t turned it on. A second later the snow hit and the swimming started. Somehow I only moved about 20 yards and stayed on top of the snow (MIRACLE) . Only being buried to my lower chest I dug myself out. My little brothers sled was running and I could hear the yelling on the radio. I could hear someone in the trees, but I couldn’t figure out where. I ran to my brothers sled and turned it off. I now could hear him screaming my name. Mistake #2 had I not been able to hear his voice I would of been lost. My beacon, probe, and shovel were all in my backpack but I would of had no clue what to do first. Let me tell you There is no worse feeling than having your little brother buried. I followed his voice and saw the top of his black helmet and his voice and started digging. About 60 seconds later I had his face uncovered. He was okay. Than came the radio chatter, where is everyone at? Was everyone okay? We didn’t realize it but the avalanche had also triggered even bigger on the other side of trees where we were. My youngest brother was able to out run it so was one of our other friends. Our 2 other friends both got hit with the wave on the FLATS. Craig and his sled were both buried. Craig got his shoot off in time, which ultimately probably saved his life. The person filming (Nate) was buried to about his face and somehow was able\"",

Cornice formation was beginning, but were still wind walls, not yet overhanging. Surface wind slab formation was also occurring, generally 5-10cm deep, 4F, and not super touchy. I did find the occasional more reactive 1F patch of snow.\n\n \n\nI was winding my way up the ridge, regularly changing directions to manage slope angle, cornice formation, firmer snow, and blustery wind. I stopped in a flat-ish spot just uphill of a tree to change directions and move left around the windward side of the cornice. \n\n \n\nI stomped a bit to pack the snow in and enable me to turn when the avalanche released. The fracture sheared nearly vertically and dropped the bulk of the cornice (which was not overhung). It also propagated along the ridgeline about 75 feet. Below the cornice was a flat moment in the snow, which retained the pictured hang fire. The convex roll just below this fractured and released a slab about 30ft across by 20ft of vert that ran downslope at least 50ft into the trees.\n\n \n\nThe cornice was a couple feet tall and 1F. The slab was about 10cm deep and on the hard side of 4F. Failure was on the interface with the old snow; noted no facets.\n",

One thing is very clear... this is truly a tragic avalanche accident-\n\nA family is out for a day of snowmobiling and they take a break for lunch in a wide open basin on the West Fork of the Duchesne. Four young family members walk to the edge of what appears to be a packed trail, however the edge is a cornice. They collapse the slope and two boys ages 7 and 14 are caught, carried, and subsequently buried at the bottom of the slope.\n\nWhile the father looks for the two boys, the mother jumps on her snowmobile and heads towards the trailhead to find help. She runs into State Parks grooming personnel who then activates 911. Wasatch and Summit County S&R along with two medical helicopters are dispatched. The small avalanche path is difficult to locate, but when the medical helicopters land, they discover the father performing CPR on both of his sons.\n\nThe two boys are flown from the scene and pass away later in the evening at the hospital.\n\nMany thanks to all the heroic efforts put forth by Wasatch and Summit County Search and Rescue along with State Parks and Air Med personnel.",

The danger was rated as Moderate for Wednesday Jan 16th and changing weather was not a factor in this accident.\n\nFrom the Jan. 16th advisory-\n\n\"Northerly winds have been brutal along the high ridges and they're having no problem whipping all the fresh new snow into stiff wind drifts. Today you'll find these chalky looking, hollow sounding slabs along the leeward side of mid and upper elevation ridges. They're most prevalent on slopes facing the south half of the compass, but I suspect you'll find a fresh drift or two cross-loaded in upper elevation chutes and gullies as well. In either case, todays slabs will break a bit wider and deeper than you might expect.\"\n",

Cold temperatures, high elevation terrain, and shallow snow depths are the norm for the range. We often see deep instabilities linger late in the season. The early portion of the winter started with a promising storm track and relatively warm temperatures. While the region experienced a large natural and remotely triggered avalanche cycle the week of Dec. 17th, in general avalanche activity has remained unusually predictable and the snowpack has been relatively strong. Very cold temperatures filtered into the region on January 11th, lasting to the 15th. Overnight lows reaching to -25 degrees were common in low laying basins with terrain features similar to the West Fork of the Duchesne. During this time about a foot of very light density snow fell. Jan. 14-17 brought very strong Northeast winds to the region. Averaging 30-40 mph with gusts into the 60's and 70's, winds channeled through this basin, forming very dense slabs in unusual locations.",

He new it would probably crack out seeing that there was a fairly distinct wind slab sitting on top of the steepest line in the bowl, and we new there was faceted snow under it because there is always facets in this N facing protected location. There were two choices, ski cut it and let it run and mess up the line or ski it fast and outrun it. The amount of new snow was not enough to pose much harm except maybe knock you down, and the run out was clean so he went for the outrun choice, which worked out fine seeing that the slide did not move very fast. The wind slab released on facets that were formed before the storm, then stepped down to the underlying crust, but petered out about 300 vertical feet down the slope when angle eased up.\n\nphotos: crown, facets beneath the wind slab, and the run out\n",

          "Comments 1": "While skinning up Grizzly Gulch, my partner and I decided to change our plans from going to Patsy Marley to skiing the south side of Grizzly Gulch.   When we changed our minds, we decided to cross the gulch at Chad's gap.  When we came to a steeper section on the way into the gulch, we decided to cross it one at a time.  While about 40ft ahead of my partner I was fooled into a false sense of security by my perceived brevity of a steep slope, and decided to continue.  Three steps into the slope the entire face broke about five feet above me.  It was a foolish decision not to turn back and continue up the cat track and around upon first sight of this slope.  Don't make the same mistake I did under the impression that it will save you time, and don't allow yourself to downplay the risks as I did: I was lucky cut to my left and stay on top of this slide.  \n\nIt is difficult to say whether the slide breaking to the facets was because of a step down from sloughing or caused entirely by my full weight being added to the snowpack.  \n\nBecause the area just above the slide still seemed liable to slide we did not get close enough to the crown for precise depth measurements, I quickly got out of the way and snapped the photos shown below, then called the slide in.

I didn't have the best view when they kicked it off, but it looked like they booted up the rocky area, put skis back on once they got above it, and then the first person up triggered this on a kick turn in a wind loaded area. It propagated maybe 50 feet across and had a crown that looked to be 12\" or so at the deepest area. (The party that triggered this continued up to the ridge without incident. The party pictured here isn't the one that triggered this, it was a group headed up after them.)\n\nWas on a timeframe so I didn't have a chance to go poke around and see what the culprit layer was, but I'd suspect facets were involved. This little zone off the ridge constantly gets stripped by the wind and always seem to harbor a thin, rotten snowpack. This isn't the most consequential terrain and getting caught in this little guy probably wouldn't have ruined your day, but in the more extreme terrain people are undoubtedly getting into today it sure could have. Low danger doesn't mean no danger... \nForecaster: also thinking this could be a lingering wind slab....\n\n\n",

Slide wasn't there Saturday and I suspect the strong winds Saturday night loaded enough snow to cause the weak snow to collapse.  This is a low elevation slope with shallow snow pack.   I wasn't able to make it up to poke around so observations are from a Saturday afternoon snowshoe outing I went on with my wife. I wasn't on this slope but other slopes in the area had weak, faceted snow all the way to the ground. There was a layer about 6\" down and I would guess that the south most section of the slide appears to have broken on and not stepped down. The north section of the slide broke further down.     This slide seems to have matched your 2/8 warning re shallow snow and low elevations almost perfectly.",

I didn't stick around to make a more detailed observation (I apologize). The propagation occurred on a convex roll over down the ridge from the summit where much smaller cornices had built up. It didn't carry much speed, but I was surprised of the overall size of the pocket that moved. - Probably a pretty common occurrence yesterday for the salt lake area wind effected terrain. Winds seem to come from every direction yesterday. It was great.",

The entire snowpack collapsed, giving way to a massive rock-well. I luckily landed on the edge of the snow and all my gear remained on top as well. Had I fallen into the bottom, this could have easily been catastrophic. Given the foggy conditions, it is unlikely that my partner would have seen me go in. After ten years in the backcountry, this is the first time something like this has happened to me. It serves as a reminder to give cliffbands and trees a wide berth and to travel with caution in areas with glide cracks. \n\n \n\nPhoto attached of the opening. Prior to me skiing across, the entire well was covered in a snowbridge. I landed prone on the edge, bottom of the photo.\n\n \n",

All the above observations were guesses, we did not investigate further as there were no tracks going into the path. \nWhat initially caught my eye was the solo track to lookers left of the slide along the tree line in the second photo. The track did not really show in the photo, but was same aspect and elevation and maybe 100 yards from the slide. Solo traveler in what is now prime terrain for a slide, in a fairly remote area. \nYipes. \nIn addition we also noticed a wet natural from a point release that entrained a pretty large amount of snow in the same drainage, same elevation, opposing aspect. We also noted a crazy variety of conditions on the east/west running ridge line we traveled on. Everything from localized whomphing, to  fully supportable sun crusts that were still dry underneath, to unsupportable facet pits, changing with each step. Hand pits showed the same tremendous amount of variety in small areas on similar aspects all of which made us pretty uncomfortable with the idea of skiing pretty much anything even a little steep. \nLow angle, north facing trees were nice skiing, though. \n \n",

          "Comments 1": "\nParty of 3 climbed to Cardiff Pass then west toward Superior. Experienced moderate wind and a few stronger gusts - consistent with the last few days' forecasts. Stopped to transition just short of Little Superior intending to ride the higher ground on SE aspect. First rider began to traverse right to reach that point and triggered the slab within seconds. Party member above reports feeling a collapse underfoot - it's possible the trigger was from above. Rider attempted to move right and didn't make much progress before falling into seated position and \"swimming\" to stay on top. Rider was carried about 60 feet before coming to a stop without burial. The slide ran at least 800? vertical feet down the gully towards Two Trees - didn't get a great look at the full path on the exit. Party continued right and descended ridges.\n\n \nIn hindsight:\n\n- We did not respect the forecast in our terrain choice. The group was familiar with recent forecasts and discussed impact of the wind multiple times but opted to continue with original objective after *very* casual observations along the skin track didn't expose activity.\n\n- A few tens of yards of climbing could have made the difference in terrain. Because we stopped short it was necessary to make a small traverse to the safer high ground, but doing so meant crossing above an obvious trap. Transitioning a bit further ahead would have kept us out of the gully and on safer terrain from the start.\n\n- The transition had thin cover in places and exposed rocks. Could have noted the weak point and taken it into account.\n\n \n\nClose call and humbling for sure.\n\n\n",

Approximately 50 feet from the chute entrance the snow started to slide and I could see spider web and the fracture line above me spreading toward Sushi Chute. The fracture line was several hundred feet wide (and wider than \"typical\" slides in that chute). I was carried several hundred feet and able to get myself out of the deposition zone. Was skiing solo. I had skied the area yesterday and the snow was wet and there appeared to be good bonding with the underlying snow pack. I had climbed up Mt. Millicent for access and there was an approximately 20 mph wind from the west and heavy slab deposits on the east fact of Milly. I watched a group test and ski cut the East Face and of Milly and release some large runs and decided against skiing that aspect. I anticipated that west facing and more protected aspects of Stupid Chute would be a safer route. I complete several ski cuts at the entrance (not much powder, solid pack) and approximately 30 feet into stupid chute (decent bonding with new snow, no noticeable wind slab). I then made 4-5 turns and the slide released.\n",

          "Comments 1": "At approximately 900 hours, almost the entire amount of the Rocky Points area avalanched naturally. This occurred during a period of high PI and wind loading with mostly Light Category winds. The Soft Slab was predominantly 4 finger in hardness. Debris piles from the Main Rocky Points Chute was the deepest at approximately one meter deep. The initial weak layer was one to two inches above the old snow/new snow interface, and then it appeared to step down to the old snow/melt freeze crust. The weak layer was a light density layer in the new snow, directly above the interface. There was some bonding to the old snow, and this appeared to be a result of the warmth in the old snow surface. Interestingly, there were facets on top of the old snow surface on the highest starting zones in the NNE facing Rocky Points Main chutes. These facets were up to 1mm and were showing signs of rounding. Also, the old snow surface crust in this area was 1 to 2 inches deep and there were moderate sized facets below this crust; and this weakness was just one of three layers that were cracking.  Widespread cracking and collapsing was occurring on all slopes with angles > 30 degrees. Slopes between 30 and 35 degrees were cracking and not moving. All slopes with angles > 35 degrees were either already cleaned out or cracking, and very sensitive and easy to initiate activity. The cracking layers were 4 to 8 inches down, as well as at the old snow surface. Propagation was pronounced and rapid. \nAnother avalanche of note was the Wet Slab observed in the lower half of the Main Dog Lake Chute. See photo. This appeared to be human triggered and produced when the snow surface was very wet/damp. The debris pile here was > one meter deep. It appeared that the trigger escaped off the slab to rider's right. This slide was 55 feet wide, 4 to 6 inches deep, and ran only 100 feet to the flats. \n",

A period of strong SW winds accompanied the event, and several natural storm/wind slab avalanches occurred on upper elevation, northerly aspects. No rain fell in areas that are generally considered avalanche terrain in the range, at least not where recreation occurs, or where there is generally sufficient snow. No other wet avalanche activity was observed. \n\n\n\nUpon arrival at the toe of the avalanche, I was confronted with what certainly appeared to be wet avalanche debris. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe starting zone was several hundred feet above the rain/snow line, and the crown was located just below the ridge crest on a slope leeward to the wind. \n\n \n\nThe crown face presented as a dry snow, storm slab with deep wind drifting on the observers right hand side. This is concurrent with other avalanches that occurred during this period. \n\n\n\nIt's my conclusion that the avalanche failed as a storm or wind slab, triggered by loading from very dense snow and strong winds a few hundred feet above the rain snow line. It did not appear to be triggered by saturation, but it certainly entrained saturated snow as it moved down in elevation giving the debris the appearance of a wet avalanche. ",

Noted both hard wind crust and soft snow. This is not a particularly steep area, maybe 30 degrees where I transitioned so was somewhat surprise to have the slope fracture on my second turn and sweep me off balance. Fortunately, the avalanche was not deep but I did go for an unwanted ride. Managed to lose a pole as I kept a handle on my airbag trigger but did not have to deploy. As has been noted by others the crust is not well bonded to underlying snow and is reason for concern.\n\n \n\nThe spot where I entered the chute was approximately 15 feet in width and my transition here could possible have created weakness in the snowpack. As I initiated my second turn on some firm wind crust the slope fractured and swept me off my feet. I was carried for 350 feet and total length of avalanche was 550 ft with a maximum width of 70 feet. Fortunately, the depth was not great and I was able to maintain a feet first position and avoid being consumed by debris nor did I have to deploy my airbag. It was difficult to determine the initial fracturing layer depth at the crown but some of the blocks towards the toe were in excess of 12\". This is heavily wind impacted area with rock outcroppings that could have been a contributing factor.\n\n \n\nCrown location 40.53527, -111.69549 elev. 10600, Toe 40.53597, -111.69372\n",

          "Comments 1": "Skiing down off the backside of Mt. Raymond, and decided to drop a steeper part of Paradise than I've done before. The top was a bit wind loaded and we assumed it might break. My companion started down and, sure enough, maybe four turns into it I heard a \"woomph\" and saw the entire top break away. I yelled down to him and he easily skied out to the left while a river of snow swept down, pulling out all the snow down to the dirt and staying within the space between the trees that stood on either side.  Clearly broke on the Thanksgiving layer. (Would have carried but not buried him, given the profile of the terrain and how much open space there was.)\n \n\nWe knew going into it that a slide was possible to likely (to certain), given that it ticked all the boxes (maybe 36°, NE-facing), and planned accordingly. \n \n\nI skied down the ridge 50 feet to a less steep part and descended without incident. \n\n \n\nMy sense is that we should expect anything over 35° (at least) and N/E-facing will slide. Not assume that it *might* but rather assume that it *will*. This was an area that I knew pretty well, but that same slope profile on something like Gobblers (more open and few exit routes), or Holy Toledo (narrow and nowhere to go when it breaks) would be hard to mitigate the risk. I worry that people assume that if something has been skied it's therefore safe. It could simply be that the person skiing it a) has a different risk profile, b) knows the area and how to manage/avoid risk (Mark White and the Monitors/No Name Bowl comes to mind), or c) was ignorant and (fortunately) lucky. I've definitely fallen into that \"c\" category. \n",

          "Accident and Rescue Summary": "Eleven snowboarders rented a private snowcat with the intent of riding in backcountry terrain. After a morning of riding a few laps without any signs of instability, the group decided to push it a little higher in elevation and further to the south. When they got to their new location, they began to assess the slope. The group was divided in their feelings about the slope, particularly because it was a little steeper. With this in mind, they positioned a few riders in safe locations in case of an avalanche. \n\nOne rider (it is unknown whether he was the first on the slope or not) decided to jump off a small cliff at the top of the hill. Upon landing, he triggered the avalanche, catching him and one other rider from the group. One of the riders suffered tibia and fibula fractures from hitting trees on the way down the slope, while the other rider was fully buried. Unfortunately, the rider who was fully buried had turned his beacon off earlier in the day because of low batteries. After the dust cleared, the other group members quickly realized that one person was buried. They desperately searched the avalanche debris, and were unable to find a transceiver signal. Eventually, they saw a board sticking out of the snow; the buried rider had decided to pow-surf the run, rather than snowboard. The group was able to use his leash to find him beneath the snow and dig him out quickly. The buried rider didn’t suffer any injuries.\n\nThe crew helped the injured rider down the mountain and into the snowcat, which immediately took off towards the trailhead. Around 5:00 pm, the snowcat was approximately 2.3 miles from the trailhead when it suddenly broke down. They had no cellphone service and could not get the snowcat working properly, so two members of the group ran 2.3 miles back to the Smith Moorehouse trailhead, got in their trucks, and drove to Kamas where they notified Search & Rescue. A medical helicopter was then dispatched and the injured rider was airlifted to the hospital. ",

          "Comments 1": "\nWe remotely triggered a D2 slide today in Martha’s Bowl underneath Pioneer Peak around 10:45 am. No one was caught or carried, but it gave us a good scare. We were headed towards Rocky Point from Brighton, following a skintrack through the rolling terrain in the Lake Mary area. I was in the lead, and our team naturally spaced out as we crossed underneath Martha’s Bowl. At the end of the traverse underneath the rocky cliffs, I skied down about a 10’ depression on the previously set skin track. None of us heard or felt a collapse or whoomp, but I thought maybe I heard a plane above. I looked up to my left to the cliffs and saw a large avalanche starting. The crown broke all the way across the bowl to a West facing aspect. We estimate the crown was about 300’ or so wide and 18”-3’ deep, possibly up to 4’ deep on the wind-loaded side of the crown.\n\nAlthough a large amount of snow was coming down, it wasn’t moving that fast. Upon seeing the release, I was able to move out of the slide path area and up onto a small raised terrain feature. Adam yelled “avalanche” and Caroline tried to get to a higher/safer area, but quickly realized that if the slide had more energy or more snow, we would have all been in real trouble. The slide stopped about 40’ from the skin track I had been on. It covered up 75’ of the skin track we had already come across, and in certain places, the skin track was covered by 4-5’ of debris because of a small terrain trap area. The slide had enough power to take out two small pine trees. \n\nFrom the start, our plan was to ski moderate terrain under 30 degrees. In retrospect, we should have stayed lower and further away from the steep slope once we got to Lake Mary and beyond. This was a serious reminder to pay attention to hangfire above and connected to lower angled slopes, and to take our team route planning and communication more seriously. We were also reminded not to blindly follow a previously set skin track. Today’s avalanche forecast read “I suspect our luck will run out soon.” I’m glad we weren’t on the other side of luck today. \n\n",

Without the echo.  I couldn't tell where it was coming from, and within a minute of hearing that noise I saw a slide start approximately 30 feet above me.  It was 10:30 A.M. It was a hard slab that broke free about 30 feet across and slid down past me putting me square in the middle of the moving snow.  I was actually able to plant myself in place and maintain my position as the hard slab broke around me.  It was deeper on the skiers left side of the slide due to wind loading.  At it's deepest it was about 8 inches (South side)... At the shallowest about 4 inches (North side).  The snow continued past me another 30 to 40 feet and then came to a stop without much trouble.\n",

Two of his friends watched from a distance and discussed going to help their companion and started putting their helmets on. They don’t know how the avalanche was triggered, but they heard something and noticed the avalanche breaking well above Dale, quickly engulfing all three riders. One friend was partially buried, the other with just a hand and foot sticking out of the snow, but he was located quickly, dug out and the two searched for their missing friend. Dale was buried about 3’ deep in a dished out terrain feature where debris piled up very deeply. No one was wearing avalanche beacons, but several probes and shovels were among the group and they found Dale about an hour later, just as Wasatch County Search and Rescue arrived.",

It took the snow right down to dirt level,\" authorities said.\nDale Christensen, 40, was flown by helicopter to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo, where he was pronounced dead.\n \n\nThe avalanche happened near the Co-op Creek area in Summit County, about 10 miles east of Heber City, near Strawberry Reservoir.\nRon Hazard, of the Wasatch County Sheriff's Office, said, \"The slide was about 200 feet wide and 1,000 feet long, and it took the snow down to dirt and rocks.\"\nThe massive slide hit three snowmobilers who were fixing one of the men's machines Monday afternoon. Two swam out; the third was buried for about 45 minutes.\n\"We started CPR immediately, and LifeFlight came in and transported the victim with CPR in progress,\" Hazard said.\nChristensen wasn't wearing an avalanche beacon.\n\"I don't know what else to say. It's dangerous out there, and the snow needs to be respected,\" Hazard said.\nThis is the third avalanche to bury people in just over a week. The first, on Dec. 23, has been described as a freak occurrence, taking place in-bounds at The Canyons resort.\nTwo people were swept away: 30-year-old Jesse Williams hit a tree and died. An 11-year-old boy survived. The area had just recently been opened. The resort said there were no indications it was unstable.\nMike Goar, of The Canyons, said at the time, \"Conditions can change sometimes by the minute, and we felt good about it again, the fact it was open for skiing yesterday, the stability of that general area, and it was OK to be opened.\"\nThen on Christmas, a second slide and a second death. This time 53-year-old Dave Balls was snowmobiling with his family when a wall of snow buried him near Thousand Peaks Recreation Park.\nSummit County Sheriff Dave Edmunds said, \"I actually know the individual very well and know the family. It's very difficult for me personally, [to be] the bearer of such bad tidings.\"\nAvalanche danger in the Western Uintahs is just below extreme right now. The Wastach Mountains are almost as dangerous.\nJust one more reminder to be prepared and know the conditions before you head out.",

The bigger looked to be a cornice drop that had initiated it above the notch of the \"Mitt\" and had occurred probably not long before we got there. The other off the cliff band looked like some natural sluffing that had occurred during the storm. Didn't ware out our welcome as we noticed wet activity starting by about 10:00am. I left around 11:00 and did not notice the slide that Mark White had posted. I'm thinking the way things were changing fast, it happened soon after I left.",

Watched that same area as well as the rest of Timp and Cascade Peak through the end of day Feb 2nd. Noted a couple other much smaller wet slides on timpanogos in the southwest aspect, but nothing else otherwise on either peak from this specific observation point.\n\n \n\nNot surprised to have seen these slides either, given how much snow we've had so far this season and the lack of direct warmth till the last couple days. On the contrary seemed like we were overdue for them in comparison to my observations in other years. Wet slides are upon us in steep sunlit terrain, so be plenty cautious of that. \n\n \n\nFirst image is at 2:00 p.m. on February 2nd and the second image is at 5:30 p.m. on February 2nd for comparison. \n",

Im not sure of the exact location name, but the shot is the next obvious draw skiers right from the eastern rock buttress. A small hop was all it took to get the slab to release. Crown was roughly 75 feet in length, slab depth was about 6-8 inches judging by the crown. The slide continued over a convexity, but did not appear to step down into any weak layers besides the storm snow. Assuming the slab debris initiated sloughing in the snow down slope. Debris reached the normal transition spot below two dogs. I was partially suprised how easily the slab propagated laterally across the starting zone. Good lesson in spatial variability for me as ski cuts on similar aspects in Silver were not reactive, however I did note a skier triggered slab of the same depth in Grizzly right below the houses there. Weather was light winds and moderate snowfall.",

There was definitely snow being transported by wind and what looked like a decent sized slide halfway down the Seagull on Tuscarora.\nOur only first hand experience was down low in Brighton - a narrow and steep chute. Ski cut at the top produced a heavy wet slide at our feet taking the full width of the chute and all the new snow. It gouged into the old snow but did not step down. The slide moved slowly and ran out after 100-150 vertical. No one was caught, no one was below.  We had started to observe roller balls in the new snow and were on our way out while taking extra care when this took place. ",

A break in the action revealed an impressive avy cycle throughout the range, but many slopes remained intact. February 7th brought the next round of heavy snow, record water totals, and raging winds. \n\nThe range has remained incredibly active since mid January. Historically large and destructive avalanches breaking to the ground have become the norm.

          "Comments 1": "Correction to Bruce Tremper's report about the 2nd slide on Superior on April 27th.  We skied Holy Toledo then traversed to the regular ridge approach up Superior, at the saddle well west of Little Superior.  We skied the north face of Superior, then skinned back to the ridge via our existing skin track.  We then traversed east to the Black Knob with the intention of skiing north aspects into Cardiff, and exiting Pole Line.    As we skinned east (not booting west, as Bruce wrote), we stayed on the north aspect of the ridge.   As we approached our descent location for the north aspect of The Black Knob, one of use peered over the south face.  There was literally no more than 6\" of ski on the ridge crest when the slide broke out directly from the top of the crest.  There was no cornice in this area.  We had no intention of being on the south face this day, especially at noon after watching other skier triggered slides two hours prior.  The south face certainly changed dramatically with daytime heating.  This soft slab acted like it was sitting on top of Teflon, and was essentially remotely triggered with no skier on the slope when it broke.

          "Comments 1": " Went up to Ben Lomond along the Cutler Ridge after looking at Snotel snow/water numbers of 30\"/4\" and 32\"/7\" for the BL 'trailhead' - 5800' and 'peak' - 8000'.   Easily found a settled 2' at the trailhead and 3' at 8000'.  Trailbreaking not difficult due to the medium density snow and the wind effect.  \nFound many many - innumerable natural avalanches both in upper Cold Canyon and Cobble Creek (to the south of BL) - with some running over 1000' (est.) and visible from the north fork park.  Most avalanches from the 12/29 cycle ran 2-3' deep and 150' wide running within the storm snow, at the old snow surface, or within the previous storm snow from last week.  \"Persistent weak layers' were searched for but never found though 'needles', interestingly enough, were often at the interfaces we looked at.  \nThe pattern for the great majority was evident - north, northeast or east - and a function of heavy snowfall or heavy snowfall and strong wind-loading.  Elevations ranged from 6500' to near the summit.  Of note, the photo below shows some debris coming up to near the standard uptrack/summertrail there at roughly 6300'.  The second photo shows the avalanches that threaten the trail. \nFor today, we saw no new avalanches, cracking, collapsing or any other signs of immediate instability.  Avalanche failure planes were often difficult to replicate with tests nearby.  Seemed like the overall danger was at the higher end of Moderate.  ",
          "Comments 2": " Slides like these were commonplace along the route along the Cutler ridge. 2-3' deep and 150' across. Hard slab, heavily wind-loaded. Upon inspection, one could tell that there were multiple failure planes within the storm snow and from the windloading. The cracks on the bed surface demonstrated that the avalanche and load had collapsed the 5\" thick old rain crust and wanted to run near the ground. Unfortunately, too much tensile and compressive strength of the 'slab' kept it in place. ",

          "Comments 1": "Spotted this avalanche on Yamaha Hill driving to the forest today.    Sled problems prevented me from getting photos and a closer look, so this is all from the highway using binoculars.  Thinking a rider from the weekend triggered this avalanche low on the slope or from the side where the slab is thinner and weaker.  Looking back a few days on the winds from nearby Windy Peak and with plenty of loose snow on the surface to blow around, this slope was fairly wind loaded and waiting for a trigger.  This slope is very typical western Uintas with large open terrain on the windward side  where winds can grab lots of snow and deposit onto the leeward side.  The avalanche broke into weak snow near the ground, dirt and vegetation was easily seen on the bed surface. ",

These looked to be from early today or yesterday. The wind was still transporting a fair amount of snow from the south into the northerly aspects when we observed the avalanches, and the paths were starting to fill back in at around 3pm today.\nAfter reading the forecast this morning, and then taking into account our observations it seems it was more HIGH with pockets of Considerable, and perhaps today's forecast may be more suited to tomorrow.

Appeared to only have sloughed 10'. Was out of town for two weeks, and ventured into the canyon to assess conditions. Naturals also occured down the main chutes in the canyon traveling what appeared to be 300+ feet. You wouldn't want to be caught in that terrain trap with conditions less than ideal. There was also aproximately 2-3\" thick of hard crust on the top layer from wet snowfall/temps rising. Not exactly a great ride down, except in the trees up high, but worth going to see current conditions. Only saw a couple other ski tracks, looks like everyone was being cautious and avoiding the main open chutes, be safe & have fun out there\n",

          "Comments 1": "After enjoying a day filled with beautiful Utah powder, my group skied Room of Doom and decided that one more lap up in Mineral Fork would be an excellent way to end an excellent day. We were all tired but on a high from the excellent skiing. It was my turn to break trail, so I started to put in the skintrack up what is known as 'Santiago' in Mineral Fork. Santiago is relatively steep (upper 30s) and is directly northeast facing. My partner and I had skied it a few weeks prior during our dry spell and we commented how the skiing was excellent because it was entirely faceted (red flag). \n\n \n\nShortly after starting up the run, I felt a collapse, heard a whomp, and saw some shooting cracks above me. Spooked, I yelled back to my partners about what I had experienced. Being on a powder high after a long day, one of my partners urged me to continue, as this was surely an anomoly. Everything so far had been rock solid. I thought about it, and generally agreed that everything else we had skied had been very stable. My friend is generally right in these situations, so I went against my gut and continued. \n\n \n\n15 yards later, I felt another collapse, and slowly the snow around me began to slide. Not knowing the extent of the avalanche, I tried to just skin out of it. It became clear that wasn't going to happen. I beared down on the bed surface, deployed my airbag and held on for dear life. Luckily, I was able to hold on and only lost a ski pole. The avalanche ran to where the slope mellowed out. \n\n \n\nThis avalanche happened in a relatively protected area. If it had happened 200 yards up the slope, we would have been on a much bigger face and the consequences could have easily been dire for me (and likely my two partners). While everyone came away unscathed, this could have easily been a very serious incident. \n\n \n\nMy group debriefed the situation and we all learned a lot from this. The takeaway message... if you experience signs of instability (like I did), trust yourself and be firm in making a safe decision for the group. \n",

          "Comments 1": "We stumbled onto an interesting avalanche today at the Ant Knolls.  To me, the most likely trigger seemed like a sledder while hill climbing.  It could have been natural but it doesn't make much sense since there was no significant new snow load and no new wind loading on that particular slope.  There was just a skiff of new snow on the bed surface indicating it probably released Sunday.\nThe weakness was facets below a fairly thick melt freeze crust.  It appears that most of this terrain avalanched in the January cycle leaving a very shallow weak snowpack.  The faceted layer was VERY loose.  \nThroughout the day, the only other activity that we saw was very minor, small pockets within the new snow that probably released Sunday when the wind picked up.  There was some wind effect along the higher terrain with some larger pillows noted.",

          "Comments 1": "Saw three avalanches while climbing up the ridge alongside Northeast Bowl this am: one broke where the bowl rolls over to 30°+ on the skier's right side of the bowl (hard to see but seems to have run 100+ feet with a crown of roughly 3 feet), another in the gully to skier's right of the bowl (which appears to have slid prior to Sunday's snow, and ran much farther than I've seen it slide before, perhaps 200+ feet), and the third right off the top of true 10420 peak (slid down to the trees below the peak and seemed to have a crown of 2-3 feet). Except for the gully shot, all seem to have slid during the high PI event on Sunday. \n\n \n\nNothing particularly surprising in any of these: all broke on steeper terrain, and none needed a skier to trigger them. Just a healthy reminder that with this snowpack, it's not a matter of *if* things will slide but *when* on anything E-N-W. I've yet to see anything over 30° that did *not* slide when a skier touched it or got close. Fun times in the Wasatch. \n",

          "Comments 1": " \n\nThis snowmobile triggered slide occurred at approximately 1200 moments before we arrived. The crown depth ranged from 2 feet to 6 feet where it was wind loaded near the cornices. On the edges of the flank below the ridge a little bit, snowpack depth was 3.2 feet which is very shallow. This path likely ran in late December based on this shallow snowpack depth.\n\nThe rider had climbed through a clearing in the trees to the lookers left of the path. Near the ridge top he sidehilled to the west in order to descend an open area. There were a few rocks poking through the snow (evidence of a thin snowpack) and he slowed down a bit. Then he saw the slope fracture. He instantly deployed his air bag back pack then turned down hill and tried to escape the avalanche.\n\nHe feathered/pumped the throttle attempting to get off the slab but it kept fracturing in front of him. About 1/3-1/2 way down the slope, he began rising up what felt like 10 feet in the air. He was afraid that his sled would then nose dive, so he hit the throttle to keep the nose of his sled up and maintain control of the sled. As he move further down slope with the avalanche, he was engulfed in the powder cloud and couldn't see anything. He pinned the throttle again and shot out of the powder cloud and ahead of the avalanche debris.\n\nHe and his two partners all carried avalanche rescue gear (avalanche beacons, shovels, probes and air bag back packs). His partners were in a safe location when the avalanche occurred. They had attended a recent avalanche awareness talk given by the Utah Avalanche Center forecaster assigned to this zone. Additionally they had read the advisory for the day and remembered the danger being mostly LOW with a few areas that included slopes like this one as being MODERATE.\n\nAir bag comments: It is remarkable that this rider was able to inflate his air bag AND maintain control of his sled to escape the avalanche. Many other riders have time to do one or the other. Additionally he was wearing the type of air bag that inflates around the head, neck and shoulders (presumably to prevent trauma to the head and neck). He reported that his focus was down hill in front of the sled, and the air bag did not in any way block his vision.\n\nPhoto below of the avalanche. Other riders had climbed the slope to the right of the avalanche. The up track of the rider who triggered this slide can  be seen to the left of the avalanche.\n",

          "Accident and Rescue Summary": " \n\nTwo skiers went for a late afternoon ski tour near Electric Lake. They made at least one run down a low angle northeast facing slope. They ascended a ridgeline and for their last run chose a steeper northeast facing slope. The first skier successfully skied to the bottom and waited for his partner out of sight of the slope. When his partner did not show up, he climbed back up a short distance and found an avalanche. He did a quick search on the surface of the avalanche debris but did not find his partner or any clues. They were not wearing avalanche transceivers, and he called for help. The victim was not carrying a shovel or probe. His partner likely did not have either, but it is unclear.\n\nEmery and Sanpete County search and rescue arrived at the scene around 8pm. Inability to assess avalanche danger on adjacent slopes, mainly due to darkness, did not allow the rescue teams to get onto the debris. A helicopter searched from the air with spot lights. At midnight the decision was made to regroup Saturday morning and continue the search. \n\nOn Saturday, January 19 the search resumed under the command of Emery County Sheriff's Office. Explosives were used to make the scene safe and ensure more avalanches would not occur. People were staged near the avalanche debris in anticipation of performing a probe line. Searchers on skis started at the top of the debris field using a RECCO device and an avalanche search dog. The search dog located the approximate location of the victim which was confirmed with and avalanche probe at approximately noon on January 19. The victim was buried a maximum of a meter deep and was found in a prone position facing downhill.\n\nMore information and photos has been posted by the Emery County Sheriff's Office HERE.\n\n \n\nLocation of crown where skier tracks enter: 39.63333 -111.25038, elevation 9520\n\nBurial location: 39.63400 -111.24742, elevation 9,080\n\nToe of debris: elevation 8,900 ft (approx.)\n\nWhile the vertical drop was about 600 feet, the slope distance this avalanche ran was 1,500 feet.",

The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE today. Human triggered avalanches are likely on the upper elevation steep slopes. Any slope with recent deposits of wind drifted snow should be avoided.\"  \n\nSince January 7th, and before the accident, the Skyline avalanche reports included 12 slab avalanches, averaging 2' deep and 200' wide.  Nine of the twelve involved faceted snow layers.  A 'heat map' of the activity is found below, depicting the pattern of the avalanche activity on an aspect/elevation diagram.\n",

All of us at the Utah Avalanche Center have had our own close calls and know how easy it is to make mistakes. No one is immune to this.\n\nHere are a few things we can learn:\n\nThis is the third avalanche fatality this winter in the United States where the victim was not wearing an avalanche transceiver. Your chances for surviving an avalanche burial are greatly increased if you wear an avalanche transceiver.\n\nIt is important to always keep an eye on your partner when they are descending avalanche terrain. This way you are quickly aware of an avalanche if one releases. If you are watching your partner when they are caught in an avalanche you have a better chance of knowing where to start your rescue effort which ultimately saves time. Time is crucial as statistics show - the greatest success of live recoveries happens within about 15 minutes of burial.\n\nThe part of the slope where these skier descended seemed fairly benign compared to the rest of the slope. It was 31 degrees in steepness where they started their descent. There was a short rollover that reached 37 degrees. Our perceptions of hazard can vary a lot, but the most important terrain factor for avalanches is slope angle.\n\n\n\nThis search and recovery was performed by Emery County Sheriff's Office and SAR, Sanpete County Sheriff's Office and SAR, Utah Department of Public Safety, Utah Division of Natural Resources, Utah Department of Transportation, Alta Ski Patrol, Forest Service LEO's, and the Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center.\n\n",

The accident took place on a steep northeast facing slope at 9500'. \n\nAspect ranges from due east to northeast.\n\nThere were many undulations in the bed surface. Many of these were caused by large rocks. It was notable while walking on the bed surface how \"rolly\" it was with many partially covered rocks. These can often serve as good trigger points where the snowpack is a bit shallower. A few of these rocks can been seen in the second photo below. ",

          "Weather Conditions and History": "We measure snowfall in terms of the snow water equivalent (SWE). In other words, its how much water the snow contains. If you melted the snow, how many of inches of water would it be. From an avalanche perspective, we don't care how much snow fell. We care how much weight was added to the snowpack. More weight = more stress. The more you stress something, the more likely it will break. When the snowpack is stressed and breaks, it produces avalanches. A rough guide is that 1 inch of SWE is about 10-12 inches of snow.\nSnowfall history can be broken down into three periods:\n\n\n\tSome snow fell in October which remained on upper elevation north facing slopes but the the snowpack started forming in most places around November 21 through December 3 when snow containing 6.7 inches of water accumulated and formed the base of the snowpack. \n\tSome snow fell between December 3 and December 22 with more significant storms around Christmas and New Years. More importantly during this time, there was a notable dry period. This clear, cold weather created weak, faceted snow (aka - sugar snow) near the surface. The weak layer which this avalanche fractured into was formed between Dec 13 and Dec 22.\n\tSignificant snowfall returned on January 6 when a 2 day storm delivered 15 inches of snow containing 1.6 inches of water. The next period of snow occurred from January 15 and ended just a few hours before this accident occurred. Snow from this storm was 12 inches containing 1.4 inches of water. These were manual snow measurements from a snow study plot very near the Electric Lake dam which is 3 miles SSE of the accident. Data from Mammoth Cottonwood Snotel (5 miles NE of accident) is also provided in a chart below. Snow from these two storms was clearly evident in the crown face of this avalanche. In photos below you can see two distinct layers that made up the slab.\n\n\nTrees surrounding this accident site were still covered with snow at the time of the accident indicating minimal wind. However, this slope may have been loaded by strong southwest winds that wrapped around this slope and cross loaded it during a period of very strong winds late on the night of Jan 17. At that time winds averaged 40-50 mph with gusts of 50-60 mph. Much of the avalanche activity occurring in this area prior to January 15 happened on wind loaded slopes. An avalanche in Rolfson Canyon was a good example.\n\n \n",

          "Comments 1": "Triggered a small slide around 9000' descending from Raymond Glade this morning. It was windy breaking trail on the way up, but there didn't seem to be a huge amount of transport. I had seen some slight cracking above ~9300', but nothing that shot more than about a foot. Descending the upper wooded headwall there was predictable sluffing, the main shot in the bowl skied normally. I opted for a WNW facing steeper exit to the gentle aspen glade below, without thinking much of it honestly. I ski cut it as always, expecting perhaps a somewhat longer-running sluff, and was a bit surprised to trigger a small soft slab avalanche. It began in the narrow choke immediately below my skis and propagated somewhat enthusiastically out on both sides as it went down, running all the way to the aspens below. It wasn't very deep, maybe 6\" at most, and wouldn't have been enough to do any harm in the terrain I was in, but it did run probably 200' vertically, until the terrain reduced in angle quite a bit. I obviously hadn't ascended this route so I didn't get a great look at the snow conditions before it went, it seemed like just the new snow, but hard to say it wasn't wind loaded too, as the wind was changing directions all morning. I descended the bedsurface and took some pictures, sorry for the poor quality, visibility was quite poor at this time (~8am), it was snowing steadily and there was a fair bit of wind. Having ski cut this exact shot many times this season with no more result than light sluffing I was a bit surprised to be honest, particularly at this aspect/elevation.\n",

          "Comments 1": "Skiing a NW chute off the far skier right side of Wolverine Cirque I triggered a soft slab avalanche failing on the interface between the roughly 12\" of new snow and the layer beneath it. The first fracture broke at the top of the line in what appeared to be a small pocket of wind loaded snow.  As I skied in front of this relatively small amount of moving snow a sequence of 4-5 additional fractures broke in front of me as I skied as quickly as possible th rest of the way down the chute.  As I neared the exit of the chute to the apron several more fractures propagated in front of and around me.  Fortunately I was able to stay on my feet throughout all of this and carry enough forward momentum to outpace the moving snow.  In reviewing the incident, it appeared the slide would have been unlikely to result in a full burial but easily could have become dangerous in hazardous terrain, or perhaps with differnt timing in the same area.\n\n \n\nThis occurred at around 2pm.  While it was overcast at this time and had been intermittently cloudy for the previous few hours it seemed that this slope had received enough sun to make it more reactive than neighboring lines off the cirque.  Additionally there appeared to be wind loading at the top of the line, and possibly in some areas lower down.  \n\n \n\n \n",

          "Comments 1": "These slides occurred in the hells canyon area in the Snowbasin side country called \"The toilet bowl\"  3 slides total, all running quite fast! faster than a normal wet side. entrenching  the ground and involving a lot of snow. Most were initiated by roller balls from ski cuts and propogated after roller balls were about basket ball size, sympathetic release on slide walls once debris pile passed. Special note on the 3rd slide, In my set up of a rescue senario for my avy class i experimented in deployment of my dummy Bil (blue shop cover all's) and filled him with snow (approx 70 lbs) tossed him down the slop and after flopping over once and 5-10 sec later he was off to the races.... took some impressive tumbles getting caught in a terrain trap and ended up getting wiped out by the post release from the upper side walls. the debris pile i couldn't ask for more for my class 75' wide and 100' long.\nThere is a unedenifyable weak layer in the snow pack that I believe played apart in the speed and amount of snow that was entrained the temp was around 40 deg f. its been along time since I've seen wet slides like this in march.  Hoping to find this week layer sat during our class check back then.....",

          "Comments 1": "Forecaster Comments: Alta has not opened for the season yet.\n\n\n\nWent up to Alta today to take a look at Main Chute on Baldy. I've had good early season success skiing that there, so we skinned up to the top of Collins to scout it, and thinking it looked relatively filled in, decided to climb up to the top of Mt. Baldy for Main Chute via Sugarloaf Pass. At the top, there was obvious wind loading on the line, but the pillow of wind loaded snow looked relatively shallow, isolated and manageable. We did not see any other tracks around the area leading to the chute or apron, so I decided to drop in and do a ski cut. A soft storm/light wind slab pulled out at my feet ripping across the length of the chute 8 to 10 inches deep. It continued down the length of the line, propagating along the width of the chute on its way down. It started slowly, and looked like it would stop, so I was surprised to see it pick up steam on the way down. I knew there had been some wind loading, but I thought the ski cut would result in a more isolated pocket pulling out. The snowpack had a bit of an upside down feeling to it. We continued down the chute, and for the first few turns, the bed surface was consolated snow that was skiable. Then, halfway down, the bed surface became more sugary, unconsoladated snow and quite rocky. Perhaps we were overly optimistic about the amount and density of new snow in the Wasatch when we decided to drop into Main Chute this morning, but I felt able to manage the ski cut and the risk appropriately. It's always a good reminder to ensure that there is no one below you when you do a ski cut at a heavily trafficed area (we were certain that there was no one in the line when we dropped in, but Main Chute has a blind turn in the middle, so we couldn't see the apron and runout zone.) Also, a small avalanche has big consequences this time of year, with the capacity to cheese grater you over some sharky rocks, so take care. I suspect this wind slab/new storm snow will stabilize within 24 to 48 hours, but on the upper elevation north facing terrain, the old snow will continue to be a problem for awhile.\n",

          "Comments 1": "Morning started off sunny warm, and only slightly breezy. By noonish clouds rolled in and the wind started blowing moderate to strong out of the west. The wind was moving around lots of snow.  We skied our first lap in two dogs. There was was an avalanche that ran from below a cornice and propagated about 75ft wide and 6-12inches deep and ran through some trees and almost to the bottom, approximately 500ft. It was on a NE aspect ~35degrees at the start zone.  There were numerous other avalanches around that had been skier triggered. One in cardiff that ran around 9am and one in Toledo chute that ran around 1030am. I am assuming that both were intentionally triggered and hopefully the skier will post their own report. The Toledo Chute one was particularly impressive as both the main chute and the alternate chute lookers left both propagated wall to wall about 8-10 inches deep, it looked like from across the way.

About halfway down the ridge there is a cornice that is almost always there getting cross-loaded. And this specific area often runs. (see: http://utahavalanchecenter.org/avalanches/20524). \n I pushed a small piece of the cornice off and it just slid 20 feet or so. So I jumped on the slab below the cornice doing a quick slope cut and skiing off the slab. The slope propagate ~100ft along the cornice and proceeded to run ~300ft down to just above the trees below. Looking at the bed surface there was a thin layer of grauple on top of about an inch of snow that had bonded well to the old hard melt freeze crust.  Looking at the crown there are two distinct layer of snow. I am guessing the top is the new wind load from today and the bottom is the new snow from yesterday, though I was not able to take a closer look. \n\n\npicture 1: crown with 2 distinct weak layers\n\npicture 2: grauple layer causing the heightened instability today\n\npicture 3: poor picture of the avalanche from below (vis had gotten pretty bad)",

I followed a filled-in skinner so maybe skier triggered? Didn't check out the crowns on account of being a bit spooked and hitting rocks. Photos didn't come out due to blowing snow.",

          "Comments 1": "Flushed the back bowl around 11am. One person skied the east side of the face sometime earlier without causing any slide. I skied the west. Each of my turns off the top released storm snow that ran on the firm crust and, given the steepness of the slope, gained speed and accumulated to approximately 2+ feet deep when it passed me by just above the choke at around 9500 feet. I cut right and came down through the normal 2 trees exit. The slide came down the cliffs below the 2 trees choke and spread out for a couple hundred feet. Terrain was multiplying the danger posed by the snow instability today. \n",

Smallish wind-slab avalanches dotted upper Cardiac and Cardiff.  Didn't see that any stepped down to basal facets.   I'm guessing that debris was composed primarily of wind crust and new snow beneath, but did no investigation to back this up.  Instead I've added a bunch of squint-and-maybe-you'll-see-something photos to get the idea across.\n",

I assumed some things and allowed my life distractions to be priority over evaluating my approach and Target. I was heading up at about 9700 ft when a disturbing sound occurred, like a muffled explosion like you might hear in the distance on a control morning at a nearby resort. I began back stepping and the snowpack started downward with another loud growl. I had just kick turned by a small group of pines and was two or three strides up from there. I backtracked and was fortunate enough to grab a couple handfuls of just stout enough boughs and was right on the edge of the slide path as it flowed over and past me trying to pull me down with it. The crown was easily 200 feet above me. \n\nI believe the slope to be more like 34/36° now, based on comparing the lines on my pole as I came back down. I should not have been there.\n\nIt was big and down to the ground, very thin faceted layer, presumably the October rot.\n\nYes. I was alone. I know. Never again. I am Lucky to be alive.\n",

Small (~6\"?) crown up in the rocks (hard to see in the photo) appeared to be the first release, which then stepped down to a deeper slab below the couloir, where the crown was ~1 to 2'.

Some of the snowmobilers became stuck and one person circled uphill and to the side of them to come help. He triggered the avalanche that buried him but the avalanche did not catch the stuck snowmobilers. They other snowmobilers began rescue efforts immediately but the victim was buried 6-8 feet deep and it took 20 minutes to extricate him. They began CPR but he did not respond.\n\nThe victim was Clinton Conover of Ferron, Utah. Everyone at the Utah Avalanche Center's hearts go out to the family and friends of the victim of this tragic accident.\n\n\n\nClinton was found just uphill of his sled,\n\n\n\nMany thanks to Larry and Jonathan from Utah State Parks. While Cody and I investigated the avalanche, these guys probed for the sled, found it, and we all teamed up to dig it out and ultimately, get it back to family members.",

Looks to be pretty fresh likely from the loading from Friday night wind events, definitely hard wind slab failing on early season basal facts and running on the ground and arresting on the trees below.  The tree line seems to be the connect the dot of weakness where the crown line is exposed. Pretty consistent westerly winds with frontal passage today, graupel filled in tracks and was not real coherent to the existing rain/wind crust. Probably more naturals in this north facing terrain, finally getting some visuals in to this terrain more to come!\n",

New snow stiffened by yesterdays winds and colder temps was very sensitive early this morning. Human trigger slides ranging 8-12\" were seen in Twin Lakes pass, Turscarora, Wolverine and Brighton. New snow seemed to settle out with solar warming, although day time temps stayed quite cool. Most aspects received sun and thus had light crust by late in the day.\nNew snow was sliding on facets above Mondays rain crust in most of the human triggered slides.

Wind loading and aspect seemed to be the biggest players\nControl work yeilded results both above and below Mondays rain event.",

          "Accident and Rescue Summary": "One snowmobiler was killed in an avalanche that he triggered on Sunday, April 4th. He was traveling north along a ridge when a cornice he was on cracked and broke off. This caused an avalanche to release below the cornice. He was carried over a cliff band. He was buried approximately 1000 feet below the ridge under 2 to 3 feet of debris. He was located by his partner with a beacon. Davis County Search and Rescue responded and the victim was extricated via helicopter.\n\nRecent snow coupled with strong winds on Saturday caused snow to be drifted into deep drifts on the lee sides of ridges. The Farmington Canyon/Francis Peak ridgeline is notoriously windy and large fresh cornices had formed.\n\nThere will be more information posted on this later today (Tuesday April 6)",

Crown varied from 4 to 2 feet deep, 175-200ft wide running to the flats at the bottom. The slide pulled out to the ground interface, and the only thing left in the bed surface was about an inch or two of rotten faceted snow, and dirt and rocks. Massive wind loading for 2 straight days finally over loaded the slope, with some help from a cornice fall. Photos, a few of the crown, and the slide path. Good call on the hazard today, if slopes like this are ripping out mid afternoon naturally the hazard is definitely high.\n",

          "Comments 1": "\nWent up to assess the large avalanches that occurred last week in Woolly Hole and Pika Cirque, and possibly get a crown profile from Woolly. Plan was to ascend the debris pile and avy path, avoiding the hanging snowfield to the west, which had not slid as everything else had during the past storm. We were hoping to ski a few inches of recycled, wind deposited pow on the bed surface that had slid on the PWL the in the days prior.\n\n \n\nWe saw evidence of apocalyptic slides on the persistent weak layer in both Woolly Hole and Pika Cirque that had run full track to the flats near the campground. There were new, broken trees 6-8” in diameter scattered about the deposition zone. Based on the debris it appears enormous soft slabs had run to the flats, and we estimated crowns to be 6-8 feet deep.\n\n \n\nWe noticed significant wind transport and spindrift on the bench above and especially the high ridges as we ascended the lower headwall, as well as two avalanches in new and wind deposited snow that released from the north facing, hanging snowfield west of our ascent route as we traveled uphill. In places where the terrain turned east we found 1” dinner plate wind slabs that would crack on top of the bed surface but weren’t deep or cohesive enough to run.\n\n \n\nWe switched to bootpacking for the final 150 feet towards the bench beneath Woolly hole, kicking steps 1-2” into firm, scoured snow on the flank of the shallow couloir. Then I kicked a step that was hollow up to my knee and released a 12-15” deep wind slab that broke 50-60’ above us and about 50’ wide. It only ran 100-200’ before stopping and neither of us were carried. Terrain was north facing just shy of 9,000 feet, 40-45 degrees where the isolated wind slab was.\n\n \n\nWith that bright red flag and increasing wind transport above we decided to call it a day and skied down nice, recycled north facing powder back to the campground and the car. We should have anticipated more irregular wind loading with the levels of transport we were seeing and been a bit more vigilant about pockety, isolated wind slabs even in the absence of PWL hazard due to the recent large slides.\n\nWith a substantial storm on the horizon we should assume the PWL will become active again as a slab builds on top of the faceted snow on the be surface. Increasing winds ahead of the front will also heighten wind slab danger in a thin, rocky snowpack.  \n\n",

On our return to the parking lot we observed through binoculars three distinct point avalanches on the west slopes to the west of where we hiked.\n\n \n\nsecond on our descent towards the second Hemongog above Alpine I was sliding down the hillside on a 30 degree slope. I started pushing a large amount of snow which broke loose from the ice layer below it. The layer was 6 to 12 inches deep. The top layer completely detached from a point where my snow shoes plowed it. It quickly grew wider and carried me with it. I rode it for a while then rolled off whereupon it kept going for a few seconds and the stopped. The result was very large. I had broken loose a slab about 10-14 feet wide and about 100 feet down slope. It was about 6-12 inches deep and did not bond whelk with the ice layer below. If the slope had been steeper it would have gone really fast and lost control. I only have a photo of the slab break that I rode which I will try to attach. \n",

Only the party likely couldn't see the results b/c the view was obscured by the trees..and continued another 50' up the ridgeline.\n\tThey next dropped a much larger cornice (see pic)...but with no results. But had the cornice continued down the slope where it became much steeper, it likely would have triggered the pocket instead of the skier. (2nd pic)\n\t\n\tUncertain if anyone went for a ride...though a catch and carry could have dragged someone through the trees below -\n",

What I originally took to be a ski track entering the looker's right avalanche was in fact a more shallow crown that then stepped down to trigger a deeper storm slab. The smaller slide was perhaps 5\" deep and 25' wide. The looker's right avalanche was triggered by a likely intentional cornice drop (though I bet they couldn't see the results b/c the trees obscured their view below. It was 16\" deep and 150' wide...though the debris over-ran the standard cat-track above Michigan City that is commonly used to get to Twin Lakes Pass. ",

The avalanche initially released 3-4' deep on a layer of facets, and spread across much of the bowl with crown depths up to 5' deep. The avalanche broke 600' wide and ran 500' down the slope into the flats. Due to the amount of hangfire, I did not measure debris depths but I would assume debris stacked up fairly deep. Plenty of cracks could be seen on sections of the slope that did not slide, and I would imagine these hanging slabs might go soon. The area was free and clear of any tracks and people.\n\n \n\nThis avalanche broke on my second ascent up the shoulder, having already put in a skin track.\n",

Crown was about a hundred feet off the ridge line. By the looks of it a cornice dropped off the ridge and hit a wind loaded depression on the slope. Crown was between 50 and 75ft wide, probably 6 to 7 feet deep at its deepest point, ran full track to the valley floor about 1200 vertical FT, did not get close enough for exact diameters, quite a bit of hang fire above. From the looks of it probably ran either the morning of the 25th or the night of the 24th. Suspected the weak layer to be somewhere around the MLK rain crust, quite a large debris pile at the bottom. Sorry for the dark pics it was starting to cloud up.",

This avalanche released on the rock slabs above the DB then went through the narrow funnel in the top of the run and fanned out on the main slope running down 3/4 of the path, there was also a separate glide avalanche skiers right on the DB. The slide ran over 1200ft taking rocks with it. The main slide buried part of my up track and one of my down tracks from Tuesday under 20ft of ice and snow in the deposition zone. Four plus days of warmer temperatures and humid wet air, not to mention 6 plus feet of snow in the last few weeks finally snapped the rubber band on these polished rock slabs and created a destructive and non-survivable rock, ice and snow avalanche. There are still many yawning glide cracks on Bonkers and the Blue Ice that have not released and need to be given respect until the temperature drops and these spring like conditions cease. \nphotos: the main slide, a crown from a separate slide in the same area and a video of the debris field.\n",

Both Naturals and Human Triggered Slides were reported. A Natural Cycle appeared to occur in the Millicent Bowl some time just after noon. Multiple slopes had releases of up to 12 inches deep with the majority 8 inches deep. The Millicent Bowl has yet to be opened this season and is un-skied terrain. In addition multiple Human Triggered slides were reported with remote triggering initiating each occurrence. Slides were easily triggered just by just approaching steep roll overs and or ridgeline break-overs from a safe distances away from the steep terrain. The majority of these slides were similar in depth to the Natural activity observed in the Millicent Bowl area with depths of slides ranging from 8 inches to 10 inches. Slides were running to transitions and were all new snow slides that appeared to be at the interface of the latest impulse that initiated at 0600 on Saturday the 10th.  \n",

          "Comments 1": "This slope has not been ridden this year, but has likely avalanched. Took a couple steps on the slope to test it and got a good collapse. Slab failed initially on mid-pack facets approximately 60 cm down from the surface. However, as the slab ran it stepped down into deeper weak layers, ultimately stepping down to the ground. \n\nThis slab illustrates our current avalanche hazard pretty well. Most slopes are stable and you can ride a lot of places. In fact we have skied areas right next to this slope. However, you can still trigger avalanches in specific terrain. Which is the definition of a moderate hazard (\"heightened avalanche conditions on specific terrain features, evaluate snow and terrain carefully; identify features of concern\"). Features of concern right now are steep northerly facing slopes that are weak and thin due to rocks, previous avalanches, etc.\n",
