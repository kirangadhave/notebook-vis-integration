There was about 4 inches of fresh snow on the debris at 8 am. There were a wide assortment of crowns, with depths ranging from 1 to about 4 ft and massive amounts of debris in the main section of the run. Aspects ranged from NW to N to NE. Debris was piled up down to nearly the thick aspens where the slope flattens. Many tracks from yesterday were covered and much of the popular run was bed surface now under 4 inches of fresh snow. There were numerous fir trees broken off, up to about 8 inches in diameter. The traditional skin track was hit in a few places and some of the paths were repeaters from earlier in the season. There was still some hang fire and we had no inclination to climb up to look at the starting zones. Our travel also took us to the area approaching Mt Raymond, below Raymond Glade, and we saw evidence of a large slide that appeared to come from the NW side of Mt Raymond, past the bottom of Piece of Pie, with debris reaching to the flat at the bottom of the small fir trees at about 8600 ft on the approach to Mt Raymond from the Main Porter Fork trail. It was noteworthy that there was evidence of a lot of skier traffic on Saturday. Since most of the popular skiable terrain was overun by the avalanche(s), it's a safe assumption that we dodged a bullet yesterday - waiting until late at night to slide was a stroke of good luck.\\n\\n\\n\\n(A. Bellomy):\\u00a0\\nTwo very large natural avalanches along the headwall of West Porter Fork. The debris ran for approximately 1,800 vertical feet and 3\\/4 of a mile in distance. Dozens of ski tracks from the previous days and a few sections of the previous skin track were covered in debris. Trees up to 12\\\" thick were snapped in half and scattered throughout the debris. The only portion of the headwall that did not avalanche in this cycle had previously slid naturally about two weeks ago.\\n\\nThere was about 5\\\" inches of new snow on the debris which leads me to believe that it ran yesterday afternoon or early evening when the PI increased. There were various crown lines. Some that were 2.5-3.5 ft deep and a few places where it stepped all the way to the ground.\\n\\nNote: I don't want to get on too much of a soap box, but this was a real eye opener for me. West Porter has grown in popularity over the last few years and a lot of people treat it as if it is a safe place to ski on higher avy danger days (myself included, admittedly). It is understandable because the main ski line is a very low angle and there are thick trees between the headwall and the main ski line. However, the reality is that West Porter has SIGNIFICANT overhead hazard from the surrounding headwall. Once you are above 8,200 feet you are exposed on three sides to a potential avalanche from above that can run through the trees and hit you on the skin track or ski lines. This is not a place I would recommend skiing on days of considerable or high avalanche danger.\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"Coordinates\":\"40.669832191946, -111.719326960160\",\"Depth_inches\":36,\"Elevation_feet\":9500.0,\"Place\":\"West Porter\",\"Vertical_inches\":12000.0,\"Width_inches\":42000},{\";Date\":\"2021-12-09\",\";Region\":\"Salt Lake\",\";Trigger\":\"Natural\",\";Weak Layer\":\"Density Change\",\"Aspect\":\"Northeast\",\"Comments 1\":\"Noted what we believe to be a natural slide near twin lakes pass today.

I made two mistakes and after thinking about I can look back and learn.  I remember when  skinning up last Friday and I was looking at the big snow crystals on the top of the snow (surface hoar) and made the comment that this could be a weak layer come next storm.  Had powder fever and totally forgot all about that observation when I headed up.  I also made the classic mistake of seeing many tracks and assuming that sincemany people had skied it that its not going to slide.  So me and my partner rode the first pitch, one at a time, with no problems.  Same line we all took off the cornice and down to the flat section last Friday.  Last time I rode that line I went skiers right of that flat section and into the main chute, however me and my partner decided to stay in the trees since that was where the best snow was.  I started the second pitch and about my third turn snow was fracturing all around me.  The fracture shot out about 15 ft to my left and about 50 feet to my right.  I carved a hard left and was eventually able to get out to the side of it.  I shouted out \\\"AVALANCHE\\\" for my partner and put the avalung in my mouth as I made the desperate carve to the left.  Another thing that kinda freaked me out was the slide started in the glade within the trees and spread out to some thick tree sections of the bowl. Slab was about 75-100 feet wide and about 14 inches thick and ran for a hundred yards.  I always kinda assume that trees were a safer choice, not last night.  My theory is that the sun was out all day and got kinda warm.  Even though those trees did not see any direct sun it got warm enough to consolidate that new snow layer into a thick slab.  The cold nights really built up some surface hoar in those sheltered tree zones making a weak layer that was not found in the main chute.  The main avalanche chute had enough daytime sun to keep those weak crystals building up actually making the gut a safer choice.

From the ridge summit of Aspens, around 8800 feet, I noticed a large southeast-facing slide off of the West Willow Ridgeline into Mule Hollow. I've skied that aspect and area several times this year, but in less sensitive snowpack conditions, and was personally surprised to see a slide there, especially since the WBSkiing app has this area labeled white, aka not steep enough to slide. It's a good lesson to use the app only as general guideline when observing slope aspects and steepness.\\u00a0\\n\\nIf I had to guess, I'd say the slide is a few hundred feet long and wide, and several feet deep. Based on where I was standing on the lower ridge summit below, I'd guess the cause was natural due to heavy wind loading from the most recent storm, and that this slide probably happened over the weekend. I did not notice any tracks going in, or near, the slide path, so I did not feel it was necessary to ski into Mule Hollow and do a proper beacon search. If I had seen tracks going into the slide, I probably would have done so.\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nLooking forward to the snowpack healing up again to sneak in some bigger lines.

The slide happened around 12:30 on our first lap. It slid in two different stages. Ed skied first and remotely triggered one pocket as he was skiing the final pitch above the trees. I skied second and skier's right of his track and remotely triggered the second pocket that broke higher and ran further out onto the face. It is hard to tell from the photos below, but the slide broke out a long way onto the face and I'm guessing the two pockets together are more than 300 feet wide. It is hard to tell just how long it ran, from our vantage point it ran below the trees and the staunchwall was not visible. There is a good chance it ran full track. The slope is north facing, I was not able to get a slope angle at the crown, but it broke at about the steepest part of the rollover. I measured 19 inches deep at the part of the crown I was able to get to, it looked deeper a little further out on the slope, maybe 24 inches at most. The slab consisted of the new snow that began falling Thursday afternoon. In the photos below you can clearly see two layers of snow comprising the slab. The bottom layer is the snow that fell Thursday into Friday morning and the top layer is the snow that started late Friday into today. Top layer is Fist density and the bottom layer is Fist Plus or maybe Four Finger Minus. This is a good example of how low density snow can still form a slab. The weak layer was a layer of Graupel between the bottom layer of the slab and the Bed Surface. There was a lot of graupel with the snow that fell Thursday into Friday. The bed surface was a thin crust that was very easy to break through. After our last storm the winds shifted and blew out of the NE, and I believe these winds are responsible for the thin crust that served as the bed surface. In my report yesterday I noted sensitive snow on this face as we walked the ridge line and experienced collapsing with loud whoomphs. We remotely triggered another part of the slope higher up the ridge on our second lap. As you are about to top out on the peak there is an island of trees on the ridge maybe 50 feet down off the peak.

I am confident that we would have been able to perform and execute a search and rescue, but I also know that we would not have been as efficient as we should have been due to lack of proper communication before the skiing began; and as we all know, speed and efficiency is paramount to a successful rescue.  \\nSecond is the classic example of jumping into dangerous terrain on a day with some of the best skiing conditions of the year and \\\"moderate\\\" danger despite the fact that we all knew of the lingering hazards that have plagued our snow-pack this year.

Although we didn't visibly see the avalanche crown because the ridgeline obscured our sight and we were in a hurry due to a south exit and increasing temperatures, we did see the the debris run down the slope through the spruce\\/fir. By the amount of debris we could tell it was not a large avalanche. I know some of the people that read this are going to say WTF?, you're reporting an avalanche and you don't know the size? The bottom line is two skiers standing on the Murdock ridge (estimated weight 320 lbs) caused an audible collapse that resulted in a shooting crack on the surface that ran 100 ft east and triggered a sympathetic pocket hardslab avalanche, immediately below the ridgeline, about 25 feet vertical feet below and 100 feet right of us.

Conditions on the skin track were fine in the shade, but upon hitting anything in the sun the snow was wet and very sticky.  We did notice a light melt freeze crust in the trees below about 8000 feet presumably from greenhousing.  The mid elevation snow on the north side of the compass seemed great.  After gaining the ridge and seeing pretty significant cornices we decided to cut one to check stability. We were the only party on the skin track up to that point and felt comfortable that no one would be approaching in the area below.  Unable to get anything sizeable to drop from the first cornice without exposing ourselves, we moved on to another more overhanging cornice up the ridge.  Of note with the first cornice, we did remark that the snow surface the smaller chunks landed on did not seem too deep, perhaps a wind slab with some new snow on top.  \\n\\nThe second cornice provided a definative result.  Upon dislodging a chunk in the 300-400 lb. range the slope below avalanched.  The avalanche was interesting in a couple ways.  It was obviously a slope that had been wind loaded, and the intitial fracture looked to be a thick wind slab 1-2.5 feet.  As the slide ran, it looked to dig into the older snow (facets) exposing logs and rocks.  My best guess is that this slope has slid earlier this season leaving a thinner snowpack and well developed facets that the new snow was on top of, but due to hangfire I was not comfortable getting onto the bed surface.  I was able to get close to the toe of the slide, but have already seen what the slope was capable of, it didn't feel the need to explore too much.  The debrie pile was spread out over a 28-29 degree slope about 1-3 ft deep.  Overall the slide was small and probably would not fully bury a person, but the energy and terrain could most certaintly cause severe trauma.  \\n\\nThis was a slope that we were comfortable skiing today before the slide and had in fact sought out due to its elevation and aspect.  I feel that there is a decent chance that if we just dropped the slope we would not have gotten it to slide under the weight of a person.  For myself and my partners today, this is a great learing experience.  By the forecast alone this slope would have fallen into the low category today.  Upon looking at the more sublte signs before going for the center punch we were able to discover a more complex situtation.  The January facets have not gone anywhere, the slope we were looking at had signs of wind loading (obvious from the cornice above, but not on the slope proper).  Ultimately this is a tough situtatation to call.       \",\"Coordinates\":\"40.659448000000, -111.710830000000\",\"Depth_inches\":24,\"Elevation_feet\":9400.0,\"Place\":\"Main Porter\",\"Vertical_inches\":3600.0,\"Width_inches\":360},{\";Date\":\"2014-01-30\",\";Region\":\"Salt Lake\",\";Trigger\":\"Skier\",\";Weak Layer\":\"Facets\",\"Aspect\":\"Northeast\",\"Comments 1\":\"Went to the PC Ridgeline expecting to see some new activity from the storm, was a bit surprised to see no natural activity. Looked at Scotts peak then decided to look into No Name because we new that was the place with the weakest snow structure, did not note any new activity in the bowl, dropped a few small cornices and only got some shallow new snow sluffs to run. Walked around the corner into the trees and dug a pit, the pit showed only 4 inches of new low density snow sitting on a fragile rain crust, with no slab just loose facets. Went back around the corner to No Name with the intentions of skiing it, noting not much of a new load or any wind effect and new the slope contained basically facets top to bottom with minimal amount or new snow. Brett went in first and noted a little bit if a slab in the very top section but 2 turns in he was in loose facets top to bottom with no slab, he skied the slope without incident. I dropped in next and made what I think was a mistake in judgment, instead of skiing to the skiers right of his tracks which was a bit lower angle, I opted for the steeper roll on skiers left side about 30ft down the slope I saw it fracture about 20ft above me and turned hard right and got off the slab, the slide washed by me and gouged down to the ground running to the transition zone and leaving a nice debris pile at the bottom. Fracture line was 5 to 11\\\" deep.\\u00a0 My thinking is that I hit a thin weak spot in the only place on the whole slope with a small slab on it, and the debris pile was so large because it cleaned out all the hang fire from the last slide I triggered in there a couple weeks ago, and cleaned out all the facets to the ground in the whole path except for the top of the starting zone. It was actually some what of a user friendly slide if that is possible. I think I hit the only sweet spot in the whole bowl that you could trigger an avalanche in.

After a great run on Bonkers we continued up the skin track into the upper reaches of Broads Fork.  My partner and myself had mentioned the possibility of a glide avalanche coming down off of blue ice and the diving board and agreed that spacing would be important on the skin across the bottom. A group of skiers who had ascended earlier in the day were heading down as we were heading up the skin track and they skied the slope bellow blue ice quickly as well. After crossing the tree patch and continuing on to the roll over that constitutes the upper basin of Broads Fork I looked back and saw that a glide avalanche had broken loose and covered the skin track and the skier tracks under blue ice. I was able to see large blocks still tumbling and the debris settling into the slope we had just crossed. This is one of those experiences that has been best described as we got away with one. Though glide avalanches may be harder to predict, rapid warming on steep smooth rock and the time of day should have played more of a factor in the decision making. Both my partner and I consider ourselves fortunate to be able to sit here and drink a beer while writing this report today. We get to take a pebble from the luck jar and put it in the experience jar. I hope the other party of skiers descending shortly before the slide can look at it the same way if they even saw the slide. There were 8 parties including ours in Broads today that we saw, glad that everyone lucked out and that no one was caught in this slide. We obviously did not go and check out the slide, but did snap some quick pictures before heading out.  You can see the slide covering 5 different ski tracks and the skin track.

After about 125 feet it stopped, I was uninjured and was able to dig my self out with ease. If I didn't fall I would have been able to ski it out with ease.  It was our second lap. Our first was on an aspect just east of us that seemed \\\"bomber.\\\"  The sluff pulled out a slab on a 40 degree slope halfway down that collected in the termination zone. The starting zone was a small pocket but was very different from the surrounding terrain--slightly steeper, slightly wind loaded (was quite sheltered--I thought), and concave. I should have stopped...but I fell anyways.  Afterward we investigated the crown from the slab. It was 20cm deep on a Q1 surface. Out of curiosity we performed a variety of CT tests, Extended column, and shear tests. All of them showed no weakness. However, the slab obviously ripped with the adjacent large sluff. The total snow pack depth was 55cm.  40 degrees, North facing, 9400 feet elevation, 1 caught and carried 175 feet, about 100 feet wide(?).  This photo shows most of the avy zone from the end of bottom. It started way up at the top where you may be able to see a  slight concave slope about 3m tall.\",\"Coordinates\":\"40.656400000000, -111.612682000000\",\"Depth_inches\":9,\"Elevation_feet\":9400.0,\"Place\":\"West Desolation Ridge\",\"Vertical_inches\":2100.0,\"Width_inches\":720},{\";Date\":\"2019-12-02\",\";Region\":\"Skyline\",\";Trigger\":\"Skier\",\";Weak Layer\":\"Facets\",\"Aspect\":\"Northeast\",\"Comments 1\":\"While doing routine fieldwork today from the safety of ridgelines, I triggered a fairly good sized avalanche.\\u00a0 I was traveling around to see if the snowpack was still capable of collapsing.\\u00a0 I got my answer.\\u00a0 This is a remote location where no one was in the drainage below me.\\n\",\"Coordinates\":\"39.445599442625, -111.352207647910\",\"Depth_inches\":30,\"Elevation_feet\":10400.0,\"Place\":\"Eliza Fork\",\"Vertical_inches\":7200.0,\"Width_inches\":1800},{\";Date\":\"2014-11-23\",\";Region\":\"Salt Lake\",\";Trigger\":\"Skier\",\";Weak Layer\":\"Facets\",\"Aspect\":\"Northeast\",\"Comments 1\":\"Another remotely triggered slide from a distance, the avalanche took out the entire bowl wall to wall, once again facets on the ground were the weak layer, pretty large slide for the amount of snow we have, running fast and leaving a good debris pile quite distance out on the flats.\\n\",\"Coordinates\":\"40.635302551334, -111.562219605570\",\"Depth_inches\":18,\"Elevation_feet\":9400.0,\"Place\":\"No Name Bowl\",\"Vertical_inches\":9600.0,\"Width_inches\":9600},{\";Date\":\"2023-03-01\",\";Region\":\"Logan\",\";Trigger\":\"Unknown\",\";Weak Layer\":\"Facets\",\"Aspect\":\"West\",\"Comments 1\":\"The snow blower triggered this one....It stepped down into snow older than the last time the snow blower came through.\\u00a0 Apparently, the giant UDOT snow blower can test slope stability pretty well.\\n\",\"Coordinates\":\"41.943699627263, -111.545970427120\",\"Depth_inches\":18,\"Elevation_feet\":6800.0,\"Place\":\"Beaver Creek Canyon\",\"Vertical_inches\":1080.0,\"Width_inches\":600},{\";Date\":\"2017-01-25\",\";Region\":\"Uintas\",\";Trigger\":\"Skier\",\";Weak Layer\":\"Facets\",\"Aspect\":\"East\",\"Comments 1\":\"Partner and I\\u00a0had been poking around on SW facing slopes all day, and finding them to be surprisingly spooky, with facets above a suncrust formed last week (see separate observation for pit profile, etc.).

We skinned up low-angle terrain beneath Toledo Bowl. \\n\\nAt about 9500 feet (thumbnail F above), we decided not to go higher into steeper terrain and to return to Alta.  As my partner descended the slope just to skiers left (east) of the pucker trees, a slough broke out on a slope that we measured later at 20 degrees.  The slough continued down slope and I shouted to my partner who skied right into the pucker trees as the slough continued its slow march downslope, eventually descending into Toledo Gully.\\n\\nWe continued slowly working our way downhill, encountering a solo skier who eventually skied ahead of us and encountered a debris pile where Toledo Gully crosses the jeep road and traditional skin track to Cardiff Pass.  The solo skier told us he witnessed no other skiers in the vicinity, but he skied ahead of us and wisely did a beacon search where there was a debris pile at the skin\\/track jeep trail, finding no signals.  We then caught up to him, had a quick discussion, and the solo skier went down perhaps 100 vertical feet further to the toe and did another search, again finding no signals.  My partner and I repeated both searches just to be sure, then returned to Alta and reported the slide to UDOT.\\n\\nPhotos below illustrate the remarkably low angle nature of the starting zone of this slide and how it ultimately descended into and down Toledo Gulch.  My partner is near the toe of the slide in the final photo, with a debris pile more than deep enough to bury someone.  A stout rain crust served as an extremely slick bed will likely be a problem tomorrow as well.  Typical practice of keeping slope angles under 30 degrees may not be sufficient in areas where this graupel on rain crust exists.\",\"Coordinates\":\"40.595171876936, -111.644585093810\",\"Depth_inches\":3,\"Elevation_feet\":9500.0,\"Place\":\"Toledo Chutes\",\"Vertical_inches\":4800.0,\"Width_inches\":360},{\";Date\":\"2020-01-19\",\";Region\":\"Logan\",\";Trigger\":\"Unknown\",\";Weak Layer\":\"Facets\",\"Aspect\":\"East\",\"Comments 1\":\"Recent natural or perhaps remote triggered avalanche of wind drifted snow\\u00a0failing on a sugary persistent weak layer observed today.\\u00a0 No tracks were noticed in the immediate area.\\u00a0 The avalanche is on an adjacent slope to one that was observed on Wednesday.\\n\",\"Coordinates\":\"41.711590998869, -111.715249270840\",\"Depth_inches\":48,\"Elevation_feet\":9300.0,\"Place\":\"Fairgrounds\",\"Vertical_inches\":3000.0,\"Width_inches\":1800},{\";Date\":\"2020-02-06\",\";Region\":\"Logan\",\";Trigger\":\"Skier\",\";Weak Layer\":\"New Snow\\/Old Snow Interface\",\"Aspect\":\"East\",\"Comments 1\":\"We intentionally triggered a storm slab avalanche consisting of heavy new snow.\\u00a0 It was very sensitive, just requiring a small chunk of cornice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0We also triggered some long shooting cracks in the drifted snow along the ridge.\\n\",\"Coordinates\":\"41.846834929008, -111.593906866630\",\"Depth_inches\":12,\"Elevation_feet\":6700.0,\"Place\":\"Hatties Bowl\",\"Vertical_inches\":4200.0,\"Width_inches\":1200},{\";Date\":\"2023-01-17\",\";Region\":\"Moab\",\";Trigger\":\"Natural\",\";Weak Layer\":\"Facets\",\"Aspect\":\"North\",\"Comments 1\":\"This avalanche ran during a storm cycle that ultimately\\u00a0produced 32\\\" of snow at 3.6\\\" SWE.

These included finding a thin rocky snowpack on the entrance (facets), the fact that Mongo No had already slid this year, and seeing many avalanches on similar aspects and elevations. (Although we categorized those as storm\\/wind slabs that likely lost the energy by today.) We counted eight avalanches just from our view from the top of Mongo No. Just that alone should have kept us on more conservative terrain. We though that the structure was better\\u00a0than it was,\\u00a0and that there was less energy in the snowpack. We were wrong, the structure in that spot and I assume in many other rocky areas in Mineral was weaker than we figured. \\u00a0This was also our third run of the day and I feel we had too much confidence brewing.
