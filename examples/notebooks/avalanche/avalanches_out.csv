A couple thoughts on the human factor aspect of this avalanche:
- Social acceptance: My friend was visiting from Moab, had never skied off Superior before, and was excited to check it out. Perhaps this influenced me to overlook some signs of wind loading. 

Tracks: This was a big one. Nearly 2 dozen people had skied the South Face on a variety of aspects before we dropped in, without incident. In the past I have considered other tracks to be a reasonable sign of stability when dealing with a wind slab hazard when there is no persistent weak layer involved.

Several slides occurred during this cycle, likely during the storm of Dec 25 or wind event of Dec 26. Difficult to tell from a distance if slide was new snow wind slab, or persistent slab down to old snow surface that existed prior to series of storms starting Dec 18.

They ascended a North-South running ridge on Mt Aire and experienced at least one collapse in low angle terrain during the approach. They skied an East aspect off the ridge and did not report any collapsing or cracking. They switched to the West side of the ridge on a slope with a NW aspect. Skier 1 descended and continued to the trailhead. Skier 2 triggered the slide, but skier 1 did not know this. Skier 2 was caught and carried approximately 75 feet downhill to some trees but was not buried and not injured. Skier 3 descended to perform a rescue.

Skier 2 was ok. Because they did not see skier 1, they assumed he was buried. They performed a beacon search but did not receive a signal. They reported that Skier 1 had been having some sort of trouble with his beacon this year; therefore, they assumed he was buried but his beacon was not working. At that point, they called 911 to get help. With no beacon signal, Skier's 2 & 3 and began probing areas with a high probability of burial (like the uphill side of trees). They scoured every inch of debris continuing to probe all likely areas. As they worked closer to the toe of the debris, they spotted skier 1's ski tracks which were not obvious. They followed his tracks to the trail head and discovered he was ok. While skiing back to the trail head, another avalanche was triggered on buried surface hoar.

We at the UAC are all very happy no one was injured or killed. We are also very appreciative that members of the party were very open and willing to talk about this incident so that the rest of us can learn and be safer. Avalanches are stressful and confusing events. What is important in this scenario is that they exposed only one person at a time to the avalanche terrain. Despite the confusion, only one person was caught. Skier 2 was lucky to have avoided trauma. Even small avalanches moving slowly can cause serious trauma. Running into a tree a 20 mph (which is slow for an avalanche) can hurt.","Not an obvious place for an avalanche other than slope steepness. It was 36 degrees at the steepest and transitioned to 34 degrees and even lower on the far side of the crown. While this is definitely avalanche terrain, from a skier's perspective it is not very steep and seemingly benign.","A ridge of high pressure with clear skies and cold nights last week created small facets and surface hoar on the snow surface. Surface hoar just like frost on a car windshield except it is very fragile and can easily be destroyed by wind or sunshine. Winds began to increase on Wednesday night (1/18) and into Thursday morning (1/19), before diminishing midday on Thursday. At the Reynolds Peak wind station at 9400 ft, winds blew generally from the S and SSW 10-15 mph with only slightly stronger gusts. A the Parleys Summit weather station at 7000 ft, the strongest winds blew 10 mph gusting to 15 mph from a generally westerly direction. In contrast, winds at 11,000 ft in Little Cottonwood Canyon briefly blew 30 mph gusting to 50 mph from the S.

A weak storm system deposited 3-5"" in the Salt Lake mountains on Thursday. This snow capped and preserved this surface hoar layer on sheltered slopes where it wasn't destroyed by the wind. Snowfall since Thursday contained 1.8 inches of water at the Parleys Summit SNOTEL site at 7500 ft just north of Summit Park and I-80. Snowfall since Thursday contained 2.08 inches of water at the Spruces weather station at 7400 ft in Big Cottonwood Canyon. On the day of the accident, we found 18-26 inches of snow on top of the surface hoar layer which corresponds well to these water numbers.","Photo of surface hoar crystals and the obvious stripe in the snowpit wall.  The blue card was inserted behind the layer to make it more visible for the photo, but it's easy to see in person.

interesting because snow in the trees and the nearby snow surface texture don't indicate any wind effects or loading. Perhaps the new snow has settled enough and bonded enough with itself to become a cohesive slab that could help drive a fracture through the faceted weak snow underneath.

As we reached the top of our ski run, we noticed what looked to be two fresh avalanches mid-slope on Sunset peak. We did not see any tracks within the immediate vicinity that could have triggered these two slab avalanches. They appeared to have been either remotely triggered from several hundred feet away or occurred naturally. 

 

The few inches of dense creamy snow from yesterday (Dec. 5th) skied very well and fast on lower angle slopes. It was great riding! Creamy, hero snow, a little went a long way.

After climbing to the top of Rocky Point we observed evidence of recent widespread cracking to ground throughout the slope from Rocky Point towards Sunset Peak and well down the slope as well. Unable to see avalanche activity from this vantage but we decided to retreat to Catherine's Pass and descend towards Brighton. While traversing towards the lake we observed these two slides that appeared to be recent with no evidence of new snow or wind loading on the bed surface or debris.

In the first picture of the bigger slide, a snowmobiler was side-hilling at mid elevation on a hill.  On the left side of the slide you can see his tracks coming out of it.  He caused a lower slab to go which started small but then the lower slab caused all of the upper to go including the cornice.  We observed other large bowls with no snowmobile tracks in or out that had gone. This was only one of multiple avalanches we either triggered or observed. The 2nd and 3rd picture is an avalanche that ww triggered remotely from our snowmobiles. We were riding around 40 yards from where the slide actually occurred.  That one slid down to the weeds and covered the trail we had just ridden in on with about 7ft of snow.  Some occurred naturally and others from snowmobiles.  Both obvious and non obvious hills were sliding down to the dirt. In both cases I think the wind was a major factor in that the cornices were huge and the wind had blown large amounts of unstable snow below those cornices.  I believe that the first picture of the bigger slide is the tallest peak in that range so I'm guessing around 10k ft. In all cases we observed the slides went from the ridgeline all the way down.

4  Saw clear signs of wind loading

5  Familiarity

6  Time constraint

7  Knew the risk, but was cavalier about my ability to handle it.

 

Made some calls to snow safety and police to notifiy that I was fine and avoid putting others at risk.  Maybe the only good choice I made.  Be careful out there, I like a margin of safety and I got too close or crossed it today.

Elevations in the Argenta area and the three Power Plant Chutes ranged from 8600 to 7000. 4. The elevation in the Mid Big Cottonwood Area that had two slides was approximately 9300. 5 All areas were harboring buried facets. 5.

We got a little surprise today in the backcountry. After 12ish runs on this northeast facing slope at about 9200' we finally hit the sweet spot a triggered a small wind slab that was 6-12"" deep. It ended up popping out about 40' wide and ran 400 vert. I was spotting Eric and immediately radioed him and he easily avoided the debris.
I followed Eric but dropped the ridge in a slightly mellower spot to the south so I could get a better look at the slide.  On the next lap I again was spotter from the peak.  Eric dropped in just south of my previous line. He was 6 or 7 turns in when the rest of the wind slab released. Luckily I was immediately on the radio and he strait lined it out of there. This second slab was much bigger and scarier.  In total, the slab was somewhere in the neighborhood of 120' wide. The crown, at the deepest, was about 24"". This one ran 500 vertical feet and piled up 4-5' deep at the bottom. 
We both thought that the initial slide was enough to release the energy from the slope and weren't too concerned about another.  
We later noticed a previously buried rock band that probably harbored the offending weak spot that made our day exciting.
What we learned....
1. Always, always have a spotter. Probably saved Eric's bacon today.
2. Pay attention to those stiff wind slabs. Even though I jumped on it as hard as possible while traversing the ridge, it was stiff enough to hang on until Eric hit the trigger.
3. Even though you haven't seen anything for many days, that stinking persistent weak layer is probably still lurking...and it's a turd that wants to kill you.
4. Always plan your escape. I was able to direct Eric with my radio yells, to his safest zone.
5. Always make sure the slope is cleared before the next rider drops in.

This one definitely woke us up. Glad we ended up safe for another day

This is small terrain, somewhat steep in the starting zone (40ish) just below small rock band, but then flattening out quickly below. To my surprise as I got over there the ssw aspect at the bottom of this drainage seemed to have a bit of hard wind slab on it. I was traversing fairly high on the slope but it fractured about 5 feet above me and propagated 30 feet wide or so. I was knocked off my feet and carried about 30 feet downhill and stopped sitting on the debris. No terrain traps present. I did have a chance to yell and my partner and another party in the area had eyes on me. This was as big of an avalanche as this terrain could have produced and was not really scary at all. However I will say that I was surprised at the presence of the wind slab in that area and it made me think that the winds from the night before could have made pockets of wind slabs in some other unusual places as well.

Went up to assess the large avalanches that occurred last week in Woolly Hole and Pika Cirque, and possibly get a crown profile from Woolly. Plan was to ascend the debris pile and avy path, avoiding the hanging snowfield to the west, which had not slid as everything else had during the past storm. We were hoping to ski a few inches of recycled, wind deposited pow on the bed surface that had slid on the PWL the in the days prior.

 

We saw evidence of apocalyptic slides on the persistent weak layer in both Woolly Hole and Pika Cirque that had run full track to the flats near the campground. There were new, broken trees 6-8” in diameter scattered about the deposition zone. Based on the debris it appears enormous soft slabs had run to the flats, and we estimated crowns to be 6-8 feet deep.

 

We noticed significant wind transport and spindrift on the bench above and especially the high ridges as we ascended the lower headwall, as well as two avalanches in new and wind deposited snow that released from the north facing, hanging snowfield west of our ascent route as we traveled uphill. In places where the terrain turned east we found 1” dinner plate wind slabs that would crack on top of the bed surface but weren’t deep or cohesive enough to run.

 

We switched to bootpacking for the final 150 feet towards the bench beneath Woolly hole, kicking steps 1-2” into firm, scoured snow on the flank of the shallow couloir. Then I kicked a step that was hollow up to my knee and released a 12-15” deep wind slab that broke 50-60’ above us and about 50’ wide. It only ran 100-200’ before stopping and neither of us were carried. Terrain was north facing just shy of 9,000 feet, 40-45 degrees where the isolated wind slab was.

 

With that bright red flag and increasing wind transport above we decided to call it a day and skied down nice, recycled north facing powder back to the campground and the car. We should have anticipated more irregular wind loading with the levels of transport we were seeing and been a bit more vigilant about pockety, isolated wind slabs even in the absence of PWL hazard due to the recent large slides.

With a substantial storm on the horizon we should assume the PWL will become active again as a slab builds on top of the faceted snow on the be surface. Increasing winds ahead of the front will also heighten wind slab danger in a thin, rocky snowpack.

2/22/2015,Salt Lake,Little Superior,Skier,Unintentionally Triggered,,,150',"1,250'",South,"10,000'",,,1.0,,,,,"I was skiing alone, coming back into Little Cottonwood Canyon from Cardiac Bowl after a long and very enjoyable morning of skiing mostly north and some east facing classic Wasatch powder. I gained the ridgeline at the Little Superior Buttress, and decided to make my descent from just above it. As I removed my skins up on the ridge, I examined the slope below. The initial portion of the run dropped about 100 feet south east facing before opening up into a broader bowl above a rock band. My intention was to make my way skiers left over to the frequently skied fin that drops from just below the buttress.
 As I gained the more south facing open bowl above the rock band, I noticed a large number of roller balls and debris coming down from above. The next thing I knew, I was in the middle of a large wet slab avalanche. I suppose the release knocked me down, but at first it seemed like the slab was moving slowly. it started gaining speed as it carried me towards a funnel through the rock band. Unfortunately I was on my back with my legs and skis above me. I was unable to move to right myself and I realized I was going over the rock band, headfirst. The snow was so dense that I easily floated on top. It was like riding a 2 foot thick churning carpet of roller balls and slush. I believe it protected me from the rocks as I went backwards over the probably 20' rock band.
It certainly cushioned the blow as I came down on the slope below. Once over the rock band, the slide continued to gain speed. I had only one ski and one pole still with me, but I managed to get an edge into the sliding snow. I fought hard with the remaining pole and my free arm to get off of the slide to skier's left, just before it poured over the choke of a second and slightly taller rock band. For what seemed like a really long time, more than a minute for sure, the wet slide just kept pouring down from above and through the choke.
With the slide over, I waited for the adrenaline rush to subside somewhat and determined that I didn't have any serious injuries. I dialed 911 to alert Alta Central about the slide and that nobody had been buried in it. As I down climbed the rock band, kicking toeholds into the remaining snow, I punched through a few places to reveal a virtual waterfall- 3-4"" of running water below the snow surface.
Another 200 feet or so below, the slide had come to a stop in a broad tongue of debris 2-3 feet deep. My lost pole and ski were easily retrieved from their final resting places atop the debris pile. Making my way down to them, the bed surface was a moistened, but still bulletproof sun crust- completely scoured of the weekend's new snow. It wasn't until the low angle apron just above the road that I ever noted the snow surface to be getting damp and manky.

Forecaster Note: It's unknown if this was a wet loose sluff, or perhaps a slab. So we've classified it as a Storm Snow slide.",,,,I doctored it to show where I got swept and where I managed to get off it. I think a whole lot of snow came down from the rocky face below the Buttress.,,"I think the cause of the slide was the days strong sun heating up south facing rocks buried beneath the new snow.  The running water I found under the snowpack on my way down after the slide, suggests to me that the slab was heating up and getting wet from below.
A number of human factors  played into the poor decision-making that led to my getting caught in this slide.
First and foremost, after a glorious morning of skiing what seemed like very stable north facing slopes, I was in a state of elation and exhaustion as I started down the south facing.  With the return of more winter like temperatures, I was not as concerned with the wet slide potential.  On top of that, I was running late and in a hurry to get back to Snowbird.  I dropped in to the slope like a victory lap.  The conditions on the other side had made me complacent, and I made no formal assessment of the snowpack, despite the change in aspect.   Lastly, a vastly less exposed route could have been taken, but I didn't want to ski back down around behind the buttress and instead chose the line above the rock band.",,1800.0,15000.0,10000.0

As we climbed, we commented on the east winds. We climbed from Alta to Pole Line Pass to Little Superior. From Little Superior, we traversed Cardiac Bowl to the base of Thundrestruck. The snow on the east aspects had been blown off the slopes leaving a firm, but edgable surface that skied well. After skiing Thunderstruck we traversed north to ski another line. We climbed the sub-ridge and commented on how there were some small wind slabs that had formed. There were only ~2"" deep and the snow was quite dense under these (it was difficult to sink a pole in). After descending the next wave of the storm moved in socking in Cardiac Bowl in a thick fog. We traversed towards Superior with the plan to ski the south face back to the road. We knew there had been an accident on the south aspect on Wednesday, but other than the small wind slabs from the prior climb, we had not seen any red flags on the north aspects. We ascended Cardiac Bowl with the plan to gain the ridge up the east chute. The snow was dense and supportable. We had not had any cracking or collapsing, and the east winds had not appeared to have loaded the mid-bowl. We were skinning about 20' apart from each other and when we were ~50' from the ridge, we felt the collapse as the slope broke 30' above us 8"" deep and propagated 150' wide. 30-40' below the crown, the slide stepped down to the next weak layer forming a smaller, secondary crown. The dense snow knocked both of us over and slowly carried us down with it. We attempted to self-arrest, but the bed surface was too soft for a whippet to stick. Both of us rode the slide down 400' before being able to arrest.

 

Curious to understand what happened and what clues we missed, we ascended the bed surface to evaluate both crowns. Our theory is that the lower bowl did not appear wind loaded since it was an open slope, but the higher slope had rock features that trapped more snow to cause additional loading.

 

A pole and a whippet were lost, the whippet was found during the ascent. 

 

From the ridge, the decision was made to boot/skin back out the ridge to Pole Line Pass as we felt the south aspect would most likely have a similar wind load and the bed surface could likely be a much harder sun layer/crust. We encountered another party of 3 on the ridge who were planning to ski that area. They were able to see the crown as they booted up the ridge and after talking with us, they also decided to retreat back down the ridge.

A crack propogated through the firm near-flat ridgetop and across the entry zone of Toots about 80 yards to the far side of the run where it was slightly steeper and the slide released. It went to the very bottom of the run, moving very fast. We later saw evidence of a similar size slide about the same distance away in the other direction off the ridge, N facing and further W (dropping into Bowman Fk). We didn't see that slide, but are pretty sure that it triggered at the same time - it was very fresh when we went around the corner and saw it. Several interesting take-aways:

The crack propagated a long ways across a heavily wind-loaded slopeof at least 35 deg steepness and same exposure without triggering anything else

This was the first collapse we saw today (but not the last). We had been lapping a sub-30 deg NW facing slope prior.

A couple of large cornice falls just S onto a steep, wind-loaded slope, same elevation and aspect, didn't trigger anything

Both slides broke to the ground (repeaters?)

There was no one and no tracks below us that we could see.  We were nowhere near being caught but if a party was transitioning or skinning below us without getting well clear of the runout zone, they would have gotten a rude surprise.

The NW facing slope we had been lapping was getting still with windblown snow but the meter or so deep column I isolated at about 8600 ft (below the ridgeline) was pretty stout and I was unable to get a shear plane when I tried to pry it off. We were sticking to a lower angle slope with tres barely open enough to ski but saw no evidence of instability, making me think slopes exposed to direct wind are very different than lee slopes with some fetch.  No surprise.

We had joked about picking someone to ski cut that slope. That would have been a Very Bad Idea (we had no intention of actually doing that).

This confirmed that conditions are very tricky right now and, combined with our current lack of low-elevation snow, leave a pretty limited set of options for anyone wanting to do some serious powder riding.  This is a good oppotunity to practice patience and very conservative decision-making.

First natural cycle of the season. After an extended dry spell, 12""-20"" of snow accompanied by mod-strong SW winds placed a significant load on a shallow and fragile snowpack. Did not get close enough to observe the crown but snowpits dug that day, and up to this point throughout the season, revealed a stratified and faceted snowpack, with the primary layer of concern being a weak layer of loose facets from early November storms sitting on top of a faceted, knife hard, melt-freeze layer formed in late October. We also observed a weak layer higher up in the snowpack that failed with a score of ECTP18, and this could also be the culprit, but due to widespread sensitivity and collapsing on the deeper, faceted layer above the crust at 35cm, I'm inclined to believe that is the weak layer involved here. This avalanche was significantly deeper than the others, which is not uncommon for this path. Deeper slabs often build under the cliffs at this location. I am unclear if the adjacent debris was from the Gravel Pit Knoll avalanche or if it was a separate slide.

We took a lower angled but brushy approach. We skied a couple of slopes below 30 degrees. Rather than climb back up to exit lower angle slopes we mistakenly decided to ski a steeper slope that we had skied several times this season. The first skier skied 6-8 turns to an island of safety and then the second skier joined the first. The third skier came down from above us to skiers left and skied the slope without incident to a lower ridge which is usually safe. The second skier then followed him down. On his third turn the slope fractured 100' above him and began to move. The first skier yelled avalanche and instructed the second skier to go left. At the same time the slope to the right fractured and slid to the ground. Another slope to our left also released and slid about the same time.

The second skier was knocked down and I lost sight of him in a cloud of snow as he was carried downhill. I followed him visually down the slope from where I lost sight of him. I yelled to our other partner that I couldn't see him hoping he had a visual. Then I spotted him a couple of hundred feet below me, on a ledge near the left edge of the debris pile, as the snow stopped moving. He lost both skis and broke both safety straps. He took a beating as he was carried through maple and scrub oak. He was pinned to the ground by dense snow around his pack unable to move until he unbuckled his pack. He stood up and found one ski nearby and I located the other ski above him in some scrub oak.

He described being caught and carried, tumbling in the snow seeing nothing but white until he came to a stop on the surface. He was pummeled by snow and branches as he was carried down the slope. No major injuries occurred but he will be bruised and pulled a hamstring. He thought he was taking his last breath and so did I. It's not a good feeling. We were lucky he was ok and able to ski out. The ridge we skied out was noted to crack more than 20 times on our exit but wasn't steep enough to slide.

What did we do wrong? We didn't pay attention to the obvious and significant cracking and collapsing as we skinned up. This was at the same elevation as the avalanche we triggered.  We chose an exit from the mountain that was too steep because we didn't want to hike up to a lower angle exit. We were lulled to sleep by good skiing earlier in the day. We didn't do a proper ski cut before skiing this slope. We didn't fully understand the effects that 4 inches of rain had on the snow pack. We thought the rain would stabilize the snow pack but it completely saturated the snow to the ground making it weaker. We didn't register or heed advice from UAC forecast.

What did we do right? We reviewed the UAC forecast before our tour. We skied one at a time utilizing islands of safety above and below the slope that avalanched. We were equipped with beacons, probes and shovels and knew how to use this gear. We practice with our beacons, probes and shovels.  We reported this slide so others can learn from our mistakes. It's embarrassing to admit we screwed up.

In summary we messed up and were very lucky that things didn't turn out worse.

We realized the snow was denser than expected and slightly inverted on our hike in but we stayed out of the wind and never felt any slabby snow. This bowl is steep at the top, 38 plus degrees, then mellows out rapidly in the middle. We ascended in the steep trees on skiers right side, did a ski cut that only produced sluffing and skied the bowl with no obvious instabilities. We proceeded to hike up again but this time went up about 10 feet higher, still on the edge of the trees. My partner was about 10 feet in front of me and stomped out a flat spot to take his skins off, next thing we know the bowl is fracturing 50ft above us. My partner was on the edge of the slide and just got pushed 2 feet. I was in the middle, got pushed into a stand of trees and got buried to the top of my chest. I also heard and felt my hamstring pop. I was still in hiking mode with toes locked in and skins on with my legs all twisted up. It required my partner to dig me out and release my skis from my feet. A few minutes after I was out we heard a pop and the middle of the bowl pulled out remotely. The first slide was 100ft wide, 18 inches at the deepest point. The next slide extended the crown to 250ft and ran to where the slope flattened out. I doubt we would’ve triggered a slide if we would have stayed lower out of the windslab. The windslab wasn’t obvious but it only makes sense in retrospect. There’s a massive cornice at the top and while the wind wasn’t out of hand it was still loading the slope right below the cornice with denser snow. Sometimes the line between triggering a slide and not is thin but it sucks to be on the wrong side of that line. Just glad I had a good partner with me and can ski on one leg fairly efficiently. Mistakes were definitely made but we live and hopefully learn from them.""

Rather than cross under a steep open slope to reach the saddle at 9500' we opted to convert in the trees about 300' below saddle. Looking upslope we saw what looked like a sluff coming downslope directly at us. It grew in size and turned out to be a natural that we believe pulled out from the headwall/cliffband above. We were not able to inspect the crown/trigger point as it was uphill out of view.

2 of 3 members were able to grab ahold of trees for safety. No members caught or carried.  Backpacks, skis, snowboard, poles were buried and had to be dug out.

Ski poles buried up to grips (see pic below). Slide ran approx 100' feet downslope past us. Enough snow to knock you off your feet and bury a rider in a terrain trap.

Even though the trees we were in seemed to be somewhat tight, we noticed after the slide that they were significantly ""flagged"".

several additional Crown Fractures down slope on both sides. Running horizontally.  That may have

been sympathetic.  There are two areas on the north side of the gully which are scoured partly to the

base.  I think one of them was from Sunday with a trigger up slope to the North.  But both got

scoured today with some dirt kicked up.

 

The trigger would have been a combination of afternoon solar heating, with additional green

housing from natural terrain shape.  Interestingly, the main Crown Fracture is tilted a bit to the

North West.  The vertical stepping seems a bit strange.

 

The only Couloirs on the West side of  Cascade that have potential for affecting Squaw Peak Road are the

I'm curious if anyone has any information about the slide, or if it was a natural.  I thought this would be a helpful addition to the last week of persistent slabs we've been having.  You can see in the pictures it started right below the Sundial, and continued almost to the base of the gully just a couple hundred feet above the height of the lake.

What was interesting is that the stauchwall (bottom edge of the slab that released) was even with the bottom edge of the rocks. Below the rocks the snowpack is deeper but also the slope angle quickly lessens.

This slide released on a layer of facets about 3-4 inches beneath an obvious layer of dust. The dust is not a factor but just a good marker and a good way to find the location of these facets. See stripe of dust in the third photo below.

Locals who've been riding in this zone all winter have been avoiding similar terrain on bigger slopes. This slide is demonstrates the wisdom of that choice. Bigger north facing terrain near rock bands will likely produce bigger avalanches. Rocky areas tend to have weaker and more faceted snow. They also have lots of good trigger points.
",,,"The buried rock in the pit wall in the photo below is a great example of a good trigger point on a slope.

Earlier in the day, we dug just under Clayton Peak first, found the dust layer, but nothing would break in my tests (ECT). This was an exposed windy location. Perhaps the faceted layer had been stripped off the snow surface before it was buried. Moved to the Rock Garden basin just east of Clayton and just north of Caribou. Dug the pit in the photo below. I purposely performed my ECT's above the rock in the pit wall to simulate being in a shallower rocky area. The ECT broke and propagated after 23 taps (ECTP23).

REPORT:

This morning 01.10.13 we hiked up to the backside via the bomb trail. There was good coverage most of the way but also an unfortunate tortilla-like, easily breakable sliver of ice on the ungroomed snow surface. The groomers were icy too. The only stellar snow was in the trees fairly high on the frontside slope (above 8000 ft.). Once over the top we descended 50-100 feet and on a Northern to NE aspect which was 25 degrees approximately we dug a pit. There is a very reactive layer right now about 8in. in depth. The column tests failed early, quickly, and in a alarming planar manner. With snow and especially wind set to arrive later today/tomorrow, please be careful out there. I wouldn't be surprised to hear of slides occurring. We saw Ryan Butterfield on our descent so maybe someone should check in on him. He was alone. Here are the stats:

General observations: 

The snow pack was 85 cm were we dug. We were just south/sw of the llama. The slope was about 25 degrees facing NE. The wind was blowing from the south/sw at a good clip. I didn't have a gage but the weather reports says 25 mph. There were several faceted layers: The first was about 8cm from the surface and the second was near the bed surface approximately 55 cm in depth.
 

Column test:

CT1 Q1 The strength of the identified layer (about 8cm deep) was super weak. The column collapsed very easily (immediately) on a faceted layer..maybe buried surface hoar. When I continued the column test the next failure occurred at CT12. We did not determine the quality of the shear as it occurred on the ground

 

Extended column test:
ECT1 Q1. Alarming failure. Reactive. Fracture extend 60cm laterally (i.e., the whole column--see image attached). This was the same layer as discussed above.  When I continued the test, no further failures were noted

I was deliberately ski cutting the top of this slope when a 10' wide, 1' deep, very soft slab released at my feet, running into the choke of the gully below me.  Below the narrowest portion of this slope, the weight of the debris released a wider avalanche below cliff bands on either side of the narrows.  On the skier's right side of this sympathetic release, the slab failed in pooled graupel that likely accumulated during one of the graupel events in the latter half of this week, and the crown in this portion of the slide was about 16 inches deep; on the skiers left side, a 20-foot wide, 2' soft slab failed on the faceted snow that sat atop the snowpack for several weeks in mid/late November.  The debris from this slide entrained quite a bit of snow, ran until the slope angle decreased significantly, and could have buried a person.  Although it was a crowded day in Silver/Days, nobody was in the area when this slide occurred.  

This slide occurred during what was likely the peak of instability during a day of moderate-heavy snowfall.  Several density changes were noted throughout the day, with heavily rimed flakes and clean, angular stellars falling in consecutive periods.  What initially seemed like a short, manageable portion of complex terrain worth navigating in order to harvest the pow-pow below, was in immediate hindsight a perfect spot to activate a couple of distinct buried weak layers.  The ""November Facets,"" which have lacked a sufficient load to propagate clean shears in snowpit tests, showed their potential with the help of significant shock-loading, and I would not be surprised if additional snow-n-blow overnight makes avalanches failing on this layer-as well as wind slabs and storm snow avalanches failing on buried graupel or various crusts-easier to trigger tommorow.  I would consider midslope terrain features, on NW-N-NE facing slopes above about 10,000', which may have been sheltered during recent wind/rain events, to be most suspicious for possible persistent slab avalanches.

I reported this slide to Alta Central, and it was in turn reported to the UAC, as a 1' deep, 50 foot wide avalanche.  Drew's snowpit is an accurate representation of the snowpack I found in the crown of this slide.  ",,,,24.0,720.0,7200.0,10300.0

On the way from East Pass to Davenport Hill, one natural, soft slab avalanche was noted in a steep, north facing gully just skiers left of east pass, which appeared to have run this morning; the 30' wide, ~6"" deep crown, and the debris in the runout, was all covered by a few inches of new snow.  Additionally, I triggered an 8"" deep, 50' wide new snow, soft slab avalanche, from a safe spot on the ridge, in the next gully to the west, near the top of Davenport Hill.  Both of these slides appeared to have failed beneath the new snow on yesterday's faceted snow surface.

After cresting the top of Davenport hill, the next portion of ridgeline to the west was nearly snow free on the south side of the ridge, and I judged the north side of the ridge to be ""not steep enough to be a problem.""  My partner and I stopped for a moment, and I stated my feelings about the slope, and then walked onto it.  Staying very close to the ridge, I immediately felt the sandbox effect of a weak snowpack beneath this morning's snow, and after taking a couple steps, the avalanche broke at my feet.  The slab moved very slowly at first, and I was able to arrest on the bed surface, although the bed surface was so loose that I felt like I was treading water, well after the slab was off to the races below me. 

Overall, the slab was an average of 10""-12"" deep, with a couple portions stepping down into the late november facets, and one portion, on the eastern extremety of the slide, releasing near the ground, with the characteristic brown snow visible at the bottom of a ~three foot deep crown.  When I stood up, I measured the slope angle where I stood to be 32 degrees, although other portions of the bed surface measured exactly 36 degrees.  In places, this slab pulled out near the ridge on portions of ~30 degree terrain.  The debris ran through dense trees below me, and well onto the flats beneath the Silver Fork Headwall.  I called my friends in West Bowl who confirmed there was no one else in the area, and then called Alta Central.  

This was a close call--if I had entered the slope further to the east, where it is steeper, I would have been on a deeper portion of the slab and would likely have been strained through dense trees before riding a large debris pile to the flats.  It was similar to what has been, to my knowledge, my only other truly close call, in which I assumed my visual impression of a slope's steepness was correct, without having actually measured it previously, or personally seeing avalanches on the slope.  In both cases, i had made a deliberate assesment of terrain and snow conditions, and judged that I was about to do the right thing.  In both cases, I was in terrain I don't ski that much--not really a silver fork guy--but which I assumed could be navigated safely.  At this point, I lack a good, constructive summary, or words of wisdom...","Marginal photo of the trees beneath the starting zone, and mangled, rotten bed surface; fog and light snowfall made a photo of the runout difficult...",,"Looking east, toward the deepest portion of the crown and steepest portion of the slope.

On my third lap in No Name Bowl today I remotely triggered a large slide which caught and carried me approximately 500’. The deep slab broke approximately 120’ above me. I’d skied the bowl 48 hrs ago and noted the entire bowl was tracked repeatedly. The underlying surface felt solid. Today there were between 9 and 11 people skiing the bowl in various groups. While there had been some dense sluffing on the first lap, it didn’t feel concerning. Concern diminished further as the bowl was quickly tracked up. As I waited for my third lap at the top I noted that there remained only a couple of alleys of clean snow. One was just north of the high point on the crest of the bowl. At the top of the alley lies a steep rocky section which will often release if touched. I chose a line slightly north of this point with the plan to move south once I was several turns into the run. After cutting into the run and feeling solid I began to descend. There was once again some sluffing but it actually felt lighter than earlier with less volume. On approximately my fifth turn I was hit by the slab and knocked over. I was buried briefly and then spat out. That cycle continued 3-5 times until I came to a stop sitting in the debris. I’m speculating that the slope angle above me combined with the persistent slab and the weight of the new snow produced this one. I’m still shocked though that between 18-21 runs prior to mine, within 60 min of mine in fact, and with some releasing sizable and long running heavy sluffs, did not pull this out. I feel pretty damn lucky today.

We had been skiing the zone all morning along with a few other skiers. We had taken three laps up the short pitch and I was going to ski a line that two other members of our group had skied the lap before. 

 

The line was estimated to be 35 degrees at the point of entry and gradually flattened out toward the apron of the chute. The chute we selected to ski had a steep drop in with a right footed turn that pointed you down a small chute estimated to be 10-15 feet wide. To the skiers right of the chute ran another short chute that was directly down the fall line and more eastern facing than the aspect we selected to ski. As I dropped in I made a right footed turn on the spine between he two chutes. This was the third track set in the chute and was the furthest toward the fall line and below the other two tracks from my group members the lap before. 

 

The drop in had clearly been wind-loaded at the top and was sitting on top of the faceted layer we are seeing throughout the snow pack. As I made my right footed turn to enter the chute that was my path into the apron the PWL failed below me and above me, estimated to be two feet deep and roughly 30' wide. The layer ripped to the ground as the angle was estimated to be above 35 degrees. I was moving faster than the slide and did not get pulled in any direction and was already moving through the chute before the snow behind me started to move down the fall line. The avalanche ran directly down the chute to my right and was probably 200' behind me. 

 

The avalanche ran directly down the chute to my right (skiers right). 

 

Two of my group members who had skied a different line were eyes on from the bottom of the objective clear of any terrain traps. The third was behind me watching from the top of the line. 

 

We had all read the report and are experienced in the backcountry. We knew the risks of all north/northeast aspects being especially dangerous with the PWL and possible wind loading. We had skied the line multiple times that day and began to feel more comfortable which was a mistake on our part. Before dropping members of the group had discussed the possibility of the chute to the right of the line sliding and had established a potential slide path. We knew that the speed of us skiing the chute would put us ahead of any potential slides, however, that was the wrong decision. 

 

While we assessed the risk correctly before hand, the fact that we pointed out a potential turn that could trigger a slide should have been enough to pull back and not ski the line.

Notes from Nielsen:

The sky cleared out around 2pm just enough to get a look at the meadow chutes area of Silver Fork, I could see the crown of a large avalanche. I estimate it was 1000-1200 feet wide. Unknown depth, how far it ran, or the trigger. I could not see tracks leading into the avalanche. There were tracks north of the avalanche, closer to Brad's line. I could also see a smaller avalanche in Ricardo's roll, but photos were hard to get of the smaller slide.

Around 2:00, the three of us took the tram to Allen Peak. We immediately noted the strong W winds loading snow onto E slopes. All three of us carried beacons and rescue equipment. Deciding to keep it safe, we worked one at a time along the traverse and down into the trees just above Easter Bowl. At around 8700', I made a turn exactly where Jon and Joel had skied through and broke the small wind slab free shown in the photo. Fortunately, the slab did not slide far, and we were all unharmed. The terrain was roughly 30-35 degrees. We continued cautiously down the lowest angle terrain possible and notified a ski patroller of the incident. 

 

The lesson here is that just because you are in a resort does not mean that you should let your guard down. Taos should be a prime example of this. There were more than a few solo riders traveling through this avalanche terrain today. And to make matters worse, we were all stuck inside a ping pong ball of a cloud with extremely flat light and limited visibility. Know the terrain you're skiing in and choose good partners both in and out of bounds. Be safe out there! 

 

Forecaster note:  some great points here - it's always good to have a partner, and keep them in sight, even at a resort.  Though the slide wasn't large enough to harm someone, reporting it to the patrol was the right thing to do.  And it's a really good example of how an increase in wind speed or change in wind direction can change the avalanche danger almost instantly.  And yes, I too, wear my beacon and carry rescue gear most days I'm at a resort.

I've never seen a slide path in the canyon before in the 5 years I've lived in it. Snow depth is around 2-3 feet on those slopes and it looks to have broke near the ground, probably 18"" crown or so with a 100+ foot width. The slope angle is 40+ degrees on these slopes, so a very steep angle. 

 

This is notable because during the winters this area is an active one for bow hunters, I've regularly seen them on these aspects hiking in the snow. The runout was around 500 feet through a few terrain traps. There's still a lot of snow on the northerly aspects below 6k feet, hikers and hunters need to be aware. Unclear what triggered this slide, possibly a large animal, we have a few herd of deer around. 

 

 

Forecaster Notes:  Thank you for the report- we have seen a few other animal triggered (?) slides in the foothills this winter (Big Cottonwood, Ogden). We went to look at this avalanche on February 20th. It stood out as unique and we wanted to see what the lower elevation snowpack looked like prior to the next storm.  This avalanche was most likely triggered by a deer on a layer of rounding facets above a melt freeze crust. It averaged 12"" deep, 18"" at the deepest on a 35 degree slope. The avalanche was 30' wide and between the 2 slides ran about 300' down the slope. It was difficult to see the debris as it dispersed into the trees.  I believe this was from an easterly canyon wind that cross loaded the slope. We did not go to the crown face as there were  cracks above the crown and not worth the risk.

I think these facets formed on the surface maybe Monday night/Tuesday morning during clear cold weather. On both S and N aspects we found it. With the desnse and upside-down new snow on top, we got ECTP2 and ECTP4 on this layer. The long propagations on this layer suggested that some facets are present.

1) We triggered several small slides along the summer trial about 5 minutes from the truck. All seemed to be wind loaded by downhill winds. One notable one was triggered from 300 feet away! Even though a small slide, this is significant propagation. Also, there was one section of trail we didn't feel comfortable crossing. We descended the trail and skinned up through dense trees to regain the trail.

2) We spotted a natural avalanche once we gained the Mineral/Mill B ridgeline. It was about 8-10 inches deep. More importantly, it was about 300 feet wide. It was unclear if wind loading triggered it or if a cornice triggered it. Another was nearby about 50 feet wide.

3) We triggered a couple more slides. One by simply walking along the ridgeline and initiating a collapse that cracked the cornices and triggered a pocket about 50 feet wide. We triggered two more by dropping cornices which were very sensitive. The first was about 25 feet wide. The second cornice triggered slide was about 200 feet wide, 6-12 inches deep. We used the second slide as a way to safely descend to lower angled terrain back to the trail.

4) Lastly I triggered a small pocket along the summer trail. Sort of intentionally, but it pushed me downhill about 10-15 feet. It broke about 25 feet wide. This pocket was a small open area right next to our skin track when we bypassed a section of trail by skinning through dense trees. I was curious if it would slide, but was skiing down and didn't think enough about it before jumping onto the slope. Its always amazing how much power the snow has even very very small slides.

Two men in their 30s left the closed Alta ski area with the intent to ride the well known terrain of Alta and Snowbird. Neither ski areas are open yet and have yet to conduct any avalanche control within their boundaries. We interviewed the victim's ski partner. To say he was shaken up is an understatement. 

While neither had any rescue gear or formal avalanche training, they were both expert skiers and knew the terrain well. They had not consulted the avalanche advisory that morning in which the danger was rated Considerable to High. They continued to Snowbird via Baldy and accessed the Peruvian Cirque to gain the Gad Valley. While ascending out of the Peruvian Cirque they remotely triggered a large avalanche that covered their tracks that they had just made. It's unclear whether they realized they had triggered this large avalanche. They gained the ridge and prepared to drop into Gad Valley.

With the partner watching, the victim dropped into the slope, immediately triggering the slide. He was carried approximately 800 feet through steep rocky terrain and reportedly went over a small cliff band and came to a stop only partially buried. The partner went down to help the victim and called for a rescue, alerting both the Snowbird Ski Patrol and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, who subsequently accessed and evacuated the victim. ",,,"This incident is difficult for many reasons.  We heard of over 10 human triggered avalanches on the day of the fatality, primarily in the upper elevation terrain in the unopened Alta ski area.  Many of those touring these slopes know the terrain well and are used to riding the terrain when the area is open and the ski patrol has already conducted avalanche control work.  There is always a reinforced feeling of safety. This terrain MUST be treated as if it were the backcountry, proper backcountry protocol must be adhered to (riding one at a time, not skiing on top of others, etc), and personal responsibility is critical (ie - be prepared with avalanche rescue gear, 1st aid equipment, and a repair kit.)

Another word on the incidents (Gunsight at Alta and this Gad Valley one).  The rescue teams from the ski areas and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue often put their necks out on the line to access and evacuate an injured party.  It was reported that other parties at Alta continued to ski and knock down avalanches into Greeley Bowl while the rescue was in progress.  Creating another incident during this situation is unacceptable.

Then we noticed more snow coming down and a snowboarder appeared, gopro on pole and everything. He stopped, saw us and didn't give us time to get out of his fall line before continuing.  Based on a short conversation after he fell near us, I think a complete lack of knowledge on his part. This is based partly on the fact that he called me ""sir"" when apologizing after a brief lecture (family friendly).

We did observe a fracture above us but below the trigger point, he likely caused a sluff which triggered the slab lower down the slope.

Also observed one natural that I guess it occurred yesterday afternoon, 400' vertical and 50' wide, soft slab, no hard debris.  Likely initialed on the cliffs above

Since the snow was visibly softer and the slope mellows fairly quickly here, we decided we could manage this and still ski Main Days. We all skied the first run without an issue. We did notice cracking from the storm slab and we had small slabs release in a few steeper sections near the waterfall exit. Not enough to bury someone, and with a clean run out, we decided to go up for another lap and choose even mellower lines with forgiving run outs. 
On the second lap, I cut further to the left where the slope was fairly mellow and I wasn't worried about anything breaking above me. However, the slope rolled over to about 38 degrees for a small section and as soon as I hit it the slope broke all around me. Interestingly, the snow was so soft I didn't feel a thing(in fact I didn't even know it was happening and kept skiing normally for probably 6-8 turns until I heard one of my partners yelling and I looked back and saw the snow chasing me and the crown where I had skied. I cut out to the left of the run out and all was fine. 
Since Main Days has only a few relatively short steep sections that have a real likelihood of sliding, we felt that we had a manageable avalanche problem. With how much cracking and small slabs we were popping out, I would say the old snow surface is bonding rather poorly, it might have started faceting a bit during this quieter period of weather, something to pay attention to the next few weeks.

It is likely the west/northwest winds on 12/22 and 12/23 created the 4"" 1F slab on top of the faceted layer where the failure occurred.

Avalanche activity on mid and upper elevation slopes facing north through east, and continued reports of collapsing and cracking, throughout the week prior to this incident indicated continued instability.

 ","This was a classic persistent slab avalanche:

1. There were numerous tracks on adjacent slopes with no evidence of avalanching;

2. The fourth skier on the slope triggered the avalanche.

With a persistent (or deep) avalanche problem, tracks on a slope are zero indication of stability. All it takes is for one person to find a weak spot and the entire slope can avalanche, taking out prior tracks. These types of avalanches also allow a rider to get well out onto a slope before avalanching, and it is not uncommon for the avalanche to fracture widely - and above the rider.

From reports we have received, more than one skier was on the slope when it avalanched. It is crucial to only expose one person at a time on a slope, and get out of the runout zone at the bottom, and then wait for the next rider to enter the slope.

Our current persistent slab structure can easily be identified by digging down 1 to 3' deeply in the snowpack. If you find the structure of strong snow (denser, harder to penetrate) over weak snow (softer, easier to penetrate) this is evidence of a poor snowpack structure, and the types of slopes that should be avoided. In the Wasatch mountains, this problem currently exists on mid and upper elevation slopes facing north through east.

Dry Fork Avalanche...Contributing Factors/Accident debrief 

On Friday, 12/29/17, around 10:30-11 am, there was an avalanche accident involving 3 clients, while I was leading a group of 8 guests with another established guide and one aspirant guide.

We decided to ski an east-facing slope of about 35 degrees: the middle entrance to Dry Fork from Alta. This slope had been skied over the previous few days without incident. I dug a hand- pit down to the facet layer and it was not reactive.

The 10 sets of tracks and an up-track on the middle entrance proper pushed me to find a cleaner line for my clients. I was lured right by untracked snow, and decided to open up slightly steeper adjacent terrain. I ski cut about 120 feet south and then skied fall-line for 250 feet, and back north to an island of safety at the bottom of the short pitch.

Although the snowpack was unreactive to my ski cut and run, I did feel some apprehension. However, I thought the run could be safely skied by individual skiers going one at a time.

The second guide, perhaps thinking he needed to be lower on the slope to keep an eye on clients as they skied further right, made a few turns on the slope to a tree. The first client then followed my traverse, and the 2nd client followed just 20 feet behind him. Then, as I watched in horror from below, 3rd client followed onto the starting zone, another 30 feet behind.

Before any of them had actually turned down the fall-line, 3 were on the traverse and it fractured about 100 wide and 2.5 feet deep, pretty much connecting the dots between them. Crown was just above the clients. All 3 were carried 100 - 200 feet. Two lost skis, but all 3 stopped without injury. Two were partially buried, but dug themselves out. One ski was not recovered.

Human Factors: 

This was a party of 11 people. We intended to split the party at the bottom of this first pitch of skiing, but we were all together to start. Communication somehow broke down and three people skied at once.

Due to low snowpack, most safe slopes in the upper Cottonwoods had already been skied by multiple parties. My decisions were affected by scarcity.

My previous guiding days in this early season had been avalanche training, where there was no reason to be on steeper terrain. These experienced, enthusiastic clients were back for their 4th season with me, and I was eager to get them out of the tracks on Point Supreme and give them some decent powder.

Second guide and I agreed on a plan “A” to ski the middle entrance to Dry Fork, but I changed to plan A+ by opening up the terrain to skier’s right.

Weather: 

We skied at 10:30-11 am, on an East aspect, and it was a warm, sunny day..

Terrain: 

This slope was 40 degrees with some rocks in bed surface. Middle entrance proper was 35. ",30.0,1200.0,4800.0,10400.0

Beautiful day, great snow! I unintentionally Triggered a  small slab, There is no way to make me sound good on this one.

 

 

This  is skiers left of huge chute. I was second person in and triggered the slide.

 

my plan was to spoon partners tracks and not monkey around on walls.  Spooning his track on turn 2,  I noticed the windowpane breaking  above me.  I continued my cut left and headed for left wall.   

 

I was pretty sure the left wall I was heading for was going to go next,    Fortunately that wall held. I watched the slide go  by.

 

It was a small slab but  enough to  knock u down but not bury.  runout ok, but would have been a 300' ride ....

 

I noticed  Density changes in storm snow, on ridge  There was some very light wind effect on ridge. 

 

On the lap before (last shot skiiers furthest left in cirque that is normally quite narrow) I was able to intentionally trigger a very small Windslab/pocket (15'x10"") on a interface of a bench and chute restart.

 

Interestingly my buddy, who likes to go fast and not turn much, went first  and  triggered nothing other than sluffs on both laps.  We bagged our plans for cirque lap 3.

The most notable was a very large, full-path slide in the Z Gully on the N side of Cherry Peak. 

The debris pile was massive ( the pictures don't do it justice). 

We observed numerous wet loose avalanches on all aspects in the drainage as well as evidence of larger slides from earlier in the season. Deposition fields were very widespread with broken trees and debris scattered over the

entire basin. 

 

Note: The ski out took work. The high snow levels made it impossible to find the summer trail and the warm snow was extra sticky, Navigation was unfun. We were lucky that the creek wasn't running higher because we had to cross (skis off) multiple times over sketchy snow bridges. All of the side creeks are running as well. We basically walked out about 7-8 miles. If you are thinking about heading out this way, I'd say don't. The water levels are only going to rise and make the creek crossings VERY dangerous if not impossible. Hiking back up to Naomi/TG is the safest option.

N, S, and E winds were observed all within seconds of each other.  Crossloaded steep terrain features of Silver Creek Peak were prime concern and proved to be reactive to ski cuts.  Two consecutive pockets pulled out in steep chutes on the east face.  Both fanned out quickly but had marked wind slab characteristics of uneven crown depths up to 12"" deep x 80' wide x 200' vertical.  Although the sun was out all day, the temps remained cold in the wind zone and never felt too warm out of the gale.  Many different user groups out and about today and so it is no wonder that the obs list includes multiple human and natural triggered avalanches being observed.  I believe the continued winds tonight and into tomorrow will make these wind slabs much less manageable and a considerable danger exists around the compass above 9500'.  This problem coupled with the persistent slab issues of NSF/SH make for a complex snowpack.  Sheltered terrain is harder to find with the NNE winds and with sunny skies people will be crawling all over looking for fresh, skiable lines.

There are many reasons to know who you’re riding with, what avalanche gear they have and what and how much avalanche training they have taken. You always hear people say, that will never happen to me. Unfortunately, you never know. It’s a risk we take every day in the backcountry.

 

We were extremely lucky today. We happened to be in the wrong place. A slide was triggered and one of our friends was caught and carried. He fought to stay on top of the snow headed downhill head first. His sled was stopped by a big pine tree and buried pretty deep. He got separated from his sled and continued down to the next tree. This is where Curtis found him within a minute or so. His hand was out of the snow. Curtis started digging to clear his airways. Justin was talking, while Curtis worked to get him the rest of the way out. His adrenaline kicked in and was going as soon as Curtis got him out.


Did we make mistakes today? Maybe. But we also did everything we have been trained to do. We checked the UAC forecast, we had our gear and used our training to make it home safe.

 ",,,"As we were riding one member of our group went across the hill and unintentionally triggered an avalanche. He was carried down slope and was able to keep himself mostly on top of the snow. He was partially buried and facing slightly down hill. I was able to get to him within about a minute of him coming to a stop. Was able to move the snow from around his face and head then dug him the rest of the way out. His sled stopped about 30' above him in a tree.

He was caught, separated from his sled and carried head downhill about 150' by the avalanche.

His partner (Curtis) saw the waving arm and was able to get to him within about a minute of the avalanche. His sled was damaged in the accident and mostly buried up against a large tree about 30' uphill from where the rider ended up, with only one ski visible.

	The incident began when an 18-year-old rider triggered a small avalanche (most likely a wet sluff) as he descended a steep slope and was taken for a ride.  He lost control of his sled as it flipped over a few times and ended up buried to the handlebars in a gully. The rider was partially buried nearby and was able to self extricate.  A second rider rode his sled down the slope and assisted the first.

	 

	According to information gathered from the father of the second rider, the avalanche was only a small part of the ordeal.   It turns out the pair had descended into a steep ravine that bottomed out in cliffs above the rock quarry at the head of the canyon.  They could not get down due to the cliffs below and they couldn't get back up the steep gully they had descended. 

	 

	Trapped by the terrain, the pair became exhausted recovering the sled and trying to get back up and out of the bottomless ravine. They called friends for help in the evening and eventually made it out of the canyon after a long night on the mountain...

Forecaster's Note: Noise does not trigger avalanches but it is possible for the rotor wash of the helicopter to trigger avalanches in rare cases.  Since many wet snow sluffs were coming down naturally all day long, it's also possible that this is a natural wet, point-release that came off the rocks at the same time.

The avalanche ran approximately 1000', with the toe stopping just above the lower cliff band of the run at 9800'. One of the other parties was transitioning to bootpack at the time and some of their gear was entrained in the slide and carried a short distance down the slope.

 

Both skiers were able to self arrest and neither were seriously injured. The lost gear was also recovered partially buried lower in the debris.

 

All three parties had noted earlier in the morning the higher than anticipated wind at the summit and had discussed possible changes to their plans depending on the loading and layering that was observed once in the line. All three parties traveled to the top of the protected skintrack in the trees to climbers right before discussing options for crossing into the main run to continue their ascent. All eight skiers crossed the main run one-at-a-time to a relative island of safety on climbers left where the intention was to further examine the wind loading. One party of three and the party of two ascended from this point approximately 50-100' and began transitioning to bootpack. The other party of three made the decision to descend from this point based on concerns about the snowpack. The first skier from this party was descending the skiers left side of the run when the avalanche was triggered above and was able to safely ski to the trees on the left before re-ascending to check on the two caught skiers.

 

Once it was determined that all skiers were safe and accounted for all three parties descended the remainder of the line separately.

 

A snowpit dug prior to the third parties decision to descend showed both new snow and wind transport resting on top of a thin crust sandwiched by small grain facets. Stability test on this layer resulted in ECTN21 with a very clean plane of shear.

The east facing slope south of Saint Charles Peak is committing because there is no good way to ride out the bottom, so you have to come back up the hill in order to exit the drainage. The party played around on adjacent slopes and two had successfully climbed back out of the 36 degree slope a few times. 

The slope had several tracks in it at the time of the avalanche. One rider climbed to the saddle on the top and watched, and a second was at the bottom also watching as the third attempted the climb. On the second attempt, the 47-year-old rider's sled did not have quite enough power to make the climb, and he turned near the top of the slope. The snow on the slope fractured even as the rider guided his sled in a rightward arc back down the hill. 

The avalanche caught rider and sled near the south flank and a large rock held up the sled for a bit while the rider was carried (he mentioned using swimming motions) to near the toe at the bottom of the avalanche, ending up about 150' below his sled, face-down and partially buried in the debris. The fourth rider was below on the slope and heading up when the slope fractured. He decided to keep his sled pointed up the hill and rode on top of the slab, the throttle pegged, track spinning like a treadmill as the slab ran underneath, leaving him safely on the bed surface. 

The other riders were able to get down to the lucky survivor and had him out of a face-down partial burial quite quickly. He was quickly spotted by his companions, and they had him out of the debris in ""really only a couple minutes."" Thankfully, now He is mainly only shaken, and recovering from minor injuries. The sled was damaged in the avalanche, but the party repaired it in the field the next day and rode it out of the hole. 

 ","This slope has a particularly notable history of avalanche accidents. It is the site of an epic January 11, 2014 rescue, where a rider was fully buried, suffered a double femur fracture, and had to be hauled up 1600' by rope. The rescue ended up going on well into the night, and involved about 50 rescuers from Cache, Franklin, and Bear Lake Counties. Read Report

The same slope was the site of a tragic fatality on February 19, 2000. Read Report 

The avalanche occurred on a mostly east facing slope and started at around 9200' in elevation. The toe of the avalanche was at around 8700'.

The fifth rider, a Snowboarder, stopped right above her and noticed fracture lines between your two tracks above them without further release. Confirmation shouts indicated no one was caught or buried.
 

The slide ran 200 feet to the toe of the deposition zone funneling through trees constricting to 20 feet at the narrowest waist. The skier and snowboarder skied the facet dead surface and took measurements along the way. The rollover was 37°. The depth was 2 to 3 feet breaking on facets a foot above the ground all the way to the bushes on the ground. 
 

At the bottom of the slope the group debriefed the event and returned safely from the side further assess the slide. Several heuristic traps were noted. The first was skiing in 30° terrain on a high/considerable day with a PWL. The second was skiing at the same time versus one at a time with eyes on. Finally, we realized that we always have a plan for skiing bigger days on ""higher consequence"" terrain. However, today the goal was to just do a ton of laps for fitness and fun. We did not discuss at the car no go zones for the day or have a firm plan. I am grateful that the slide broke under my skis and that I had the quickness to react. I am lucky to have received the freebie reminder that 37° is also ""high consequence"" even though it looks mellow.

We proceeded out the gate on top of Peak 9990 above Park City Mountain Resort and skinned up the back of Conehead. We didn't feel comfortable skiing the terrain off Conehead given current avalanche conditions (fresh snow, windloading), so we proceeded down ridge (South) towards our intended run, Movie Line, which is lower angle and has a more NE aspect, rather than E. We skied one run in Movie Line with no avalanche issues, but were surprised when we got back to the 9990 lift that it appeared a small pocket had ripped out in Hanky Panky, a spot just north of Movie Line. We proceeded back up the lift, up the skin track, and over to Movie Line again. We elected to ski Movie Line again rather than several untracked options further north (near Hanky Panky) because of the recent small avalanche. Upon the first skier entering movie line, the other members of the party noticed a loud whomping sound and seemingly dozens of micro cracks shooting across the terrain. The slope held, and the remaining skiers selected a safer line just to the South. Halfway down Movie Line, where the slope rolls over a little into steeper terrain, the first skier triggered a small (10"" deep, 50' wide) avalanche and skied out of it without knowing about it. The snow didn't move very far, but we were able to observe a clear crown and thin snowpack in the bed surface.

 

Overall, all skiers felt comfortable in the situation and considered more of a ""terrain management"" exercize than a dangerous situation. The alarming thing to us, however, was just how rare it was to all of us to observe even small avalanche activity in this area of Dutches Draw. In my experience skiing this terrain for the last 15 years, I don't believe I have seen any avalanche activity in Movie Line, other than the bottom rollover section. Seeing one slide in Hanky Panky and another near avalanche at the top of Movie Line tells me that we have an unusually weak and shallow snowpack.

From the reporting party:


I wasn’t going to post this because I really didn’t want my wife to know. But if I can spread awareness and talk even one person into getting a beacon then it’s worth it. My buddy Rob and I were side hilling this slope. I was leading and a little higher and made it through when I looked back the snow and Rob were gone! We flew back to find him! I launched my bike up into the avalanche where I saw a hand sticking out of the snow. It was Rob!! I got his head free and started looking for others. We had 4 guys un accounted for. 2 guys rolled up and we radioed the others! Super lucky! I learned a couple things!

1- just because there are tracks across a side hill doesn’t make it safe

2- Know the number of guys you are with because thinking of all the names of the guys in your group is seriously hard when you are wondering if one of them is buried!

3- radios are a tool I never thought I’d use in an avalanche situation

4- i will admit to this! Keeping your composure and staying calm in that situation is near impossible! I lost it!

About 2/3 of the way down the pitch, I was hit by a slough and my feet were taken out from beneath me. Luckily, my skis ended up across the slope and without much effort I stopped myself and let the slough flow around and over me. After the dust settled a few seconds later, I was sitting above a small grove of scrub oak near the black X. Getting dragged into the patch might've been a bad time. The pocket that released was immediately below my safe spot. Overall, the slough ran about 200' vertical. Our 2nd and 3rd runs were on S-facing terrain which felt more settled/less inverted.

skibum is most likely referring to me... skied supe with telethor, tt's cousin and whapworth this morning, what an amazing run that is. great snow, noticed some debris in the usual spots but nothing too scary. left those guys at the bottom to go ski the bird with a buddy, and had a great day there too. about 2-3pm, i decided to ski out to white pine with a couple guys, one happened to be a coach for the SB freeski team and longtime ripper so i was confident following his lead, especially after our amazing run down sketchier SE superior. we skied to the very top of scotty's, scoped a little, and he dropped first, noticing sloughing but nothing much. since it was N facing and i was thinking it had been pretty cold with inconsistent sun all day, wet slabs were the last thing in my mind, and breaking off a deep slab was also not really something i was worried about. i dropped second in our party of three. made 2-3 turns on the spine i dropped on, and then got the feeling something wasn't right. figured some slough was chasing me, tried to stay high on the shoulder, but a BIG slab had ripped out above and around me. the rest is a blur, but i got taken in the 500-1000 foot range down the slope, maybe 2-300 vert. couldn't get my avalung in, as i think my shoulders had already popped from swimming when i went for it, my head went under a few times, and i came very close to numerous large trees. ended up in the open area underneath, with a bit of snow over my legs (whice were above my head), but head and most of body up. both skis/poles were apparently gone (partner found 2 skis 1 pole), and my shoulders were both completely dislocated, but i was up and OK. later on in the clinic (I somehow managed to avoid a chopper ride and skied the final ~1500 vert out, hunched over and in some serious pain) i heard it was 3-4 feet at the crown, and 200 feet wide. no idea how deep the debris was, though it didn't seem very deep where i ended up, but with the amount of snow that came down i am sure it could have buried me (my partner was luckily around 100 feet away from my resting place). it was by far the scariest moment of my entire life, and by sheer luck, and maybe a bit of help from the swimming, i made it, but it could have very easily turned out differently had i smashed one of the large trees or ended up in a different spot in the debris. i don't know if it was stupidity in not recognizing the significant warming from morning to afternoon, or an anomaly that i happened to strike in just the right place, but regardless i am thankful to be alive and happy no one else was involved. i plan on calling the UAC tomorrow and giving them my full account of what happened (i got home from the OR, where they had to completely get me under to get my L shoulder back in, around midnight tonight), and am very interested to read the full report. i learned a sobering lesson the hard way, but am lucky to live to ski another day, though i have a feeling it is going to take awhile for me to feel comfortable beyond the boundaries again. be careful out there guys, i am surprised and grateful that after my ride on a day when people were getting after much bigger stuff then scotty's, no one else was apparently injured or worse.",,,,,,,20.0,600.0,3600.0,

On Saturday the 30th around 1300 a single snowboarder in a group of 4 had a close call, when he exited our terrain via the James Peak ridge line and into uncontrolled backcountry terrain. This slide path is named ""Scrapies"" for its otherwise flat rocky outcrops and narrow chokes in 2 separate chutes. This slide path is a regular producer and typically runs a natural cycle with even small amounts of new snow and south west winds due to large fetch zones. Avalanche classes of R1-2 and D1-2 are regular and typical December-February, with R2-3 and D2-3 usually occurring late in the season with higher annual snow totals and bridging of rocky anchors. Spring time regularly brings high incidents melt freeze and wet loose activity and incidents like this.

This incident was classified as a SS-ARu-R2-D2-I; 30 cm crown, 250-300’ wide, running 1000-1250 vertical feet; the starting zone is skiers right of center @9200', E aspect, 45-degree slope. The snowboarder was carried approximately 600 vertical feet, over several large rock outcrops before being able to stand up and exit the path skier's right back into the area boundary. Fortunately, we were able to contact the triggering party soon after it was observed and confirmed that there were no injuries or burials.

Based upon our investigation on the right flank adjacent to the starting zone, we found that the avalanche comprised of new snow from storm #33 in the form of a well-connected slab. This slab which likely rode on a slick bed surface comprised of melt freeze forms, and a buried NSF layer. This layer was very small and difficult to identify in grain identification, but was very noticeable with a brush to the pit wall (it is possible that the layer was simply a density interface from the onset of storm #33). An Extended Column Test ECT was performed and initial movement in the slab was noted at tap #7-8 with the column failing on tap #14, it broke with a classic “Pop” & “Drop”. The deposition zone was nearly 1000’ long and ranged from 6” to 3’ deep at the toe, it should be noted that gouging and wet loose type debris were found in the deposition.

***Note*** Powder Mountain and this terrain is located on private property, we limit access to this terrain and many other areas with a Closed Area Boundary Policy. Over the past several seasons we have encountered several incidents in areas adjacent to our area boundary that affect SR 158 (Powder Mountain Hwy) and this terrain accessed via James Peak.

They were part of a group of 8 containing 3 guides and 5 clients who ascended Gobbler's ridge via Baker pass. They observed a size 2.5 (destructive scale) natural avalanche from the previous day on an east facing slope on Mt. Raymond but no cracking, collapsing or other signs of instability on the day of the accident.

Bradley and one client descended a south facing avalanche path west of and adjacent to the path of the fatal avalanche. After this run the client left the area because he had a meeting in town at 12:30 p.m. They skied the slope without incident while the rest of the group skied a north westerly facing, treed slope known as the “Benign Line.”

After the first run Bradley re-ascended the ridge and approached the top of the run called Whitesnake. He was joined by three others, one of whom was Douglas Green, and an apprentice guide. The third guide and one other client skied the “Benign Line” again.

Bradley dropped into the Whitesnake path, made a few ski cuts, and stopped 300' downhill at an island of safety on skier’s right about a foot above and to the side of where the avalanche released (see photo). He directed Green to ski to him. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run. After regrouping, Bradley began skiing again and directed Green to remain where they had stopped. While skiing the next section, the guide felt the slope collapse (which is the weak layer failing just before the avalanche releases). At the same time he noticed Green had started skiing as well. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run.

Bradley was caught in the avalanche but continued moving right. He impacted a tree and was pushed upward by the avalanche but not carried downhill. He was partially buried and sustained minor injuries. Green was carried downhill and fully buried. He inflated his avalanche air-bag backpack at some point during the avalanche.

After extricating himself from avalanche debris, Bradley skied down the scoured avalanche path and around an exposed rock band where he triggered a small avalanche. He started a beacon search at the edge of the avalanche debris. After covering several hundred yards of debris, he acquired the Green’s signal. His beacon indicated a distance of 77 meters. At the burial location the smallest distance displayed by his beacon was 0.9 meters. He pinpointed Green’s exact location with an avalanche probe.

Green was fully buried on his side with his head approximately 3 feet deep and his body approximately 4-5 feet. His avalanche airbag was inflated. Maximum debris depth was 15 feet. Bradley dug him out of the debris and began CPR. He could not find a pulse. The apprentice guide and two other skiers arrived about a minute after Bradley began digging. They assisted in the exhausting work of digging Green out of the debris. The avalanche was reported at 14:30 to Alta Central Dispatch by the third guide. A medical helicopter landed and evacuated both the Bradley and Green to a hospital in Salt Lake City where Green was pronounced deceased.

The enormous debris pile snapped aspen trees and covered the terrain trap gully below the avalanche path for hundreds of yards. There was no stauchwall or lower boundary of the avalanche because the slab covering the entire slope released, creating an enormous amount of avalanche debris. The avalanche - estimated at 1-2' deep and 600' wide, pulled down every bit of snow between the starting zone near the ridge at 10,000' and well into the gulley at 9000'. The alpha angle, the angle from the toe of the debris to the crown, was 22 degrees.

The Utah Avalanche Center rated the avalanche danger in this terrain as Considerable and had issued an Avalanche Warning on January 21, 2016. See danger rose and bottom line below from that day’s advisory.



“There [are] many weak layers and issues that will cause avalanches today. All the red flags are present. Widespread recent avalanche activity both natural and human triggered, recent snow and strong winds, widespread faceted layers in the snowpack, and today will have strong sunshine and temperatures possibly going above freezing. All these factors combine to make very dangerous avalanche conditions and a HIGH avalanche danger.”

The full advisory from that day can be found at:

https://utahavalanchecenter.org/advisory/salt-lake/01/21/2016

 ","The Whitesnake avalanche path just below the west summit of Gobbler's Knob at 10,246' has a steep starting zone that funnels into a narrow, rocky gully. The starting zone aspects ran from 107 degrees ESE to 215 degrees SSW. The upper starting zone was cross-loaded from strong west to northwest winds in the late evening of January 19 into January 20. Slope angles across the crown were not measured as conditions remained too hazardous to access the fracture line, though the starting zone is estimated at 35-37 degrees. Two adjacent slopes avalanched naturally several days later on January 24 and January 27.","The weather has been complex this winter. November’s snow was followed by a long, dry spell with only small, intermittent snow storms through early December. Periodic cold temperatures and clear skies faceted the shallow snowpack on shady slopes during this time. A series of storms between December 12th and 25th added several feet of snow to the snow pack and led to a major avalanche cycle.

Weather events became even more complex in January. The New Year was ushered in with a strong southeasterly wind event that scoured and loaded unusual aspects, producing another avalanche cycle. This was followed by small, almost daily storms between January 3rd and 8th. A dry spell between January 9th and 13th, with warm sunny days and clear cold nights, developed near surface facets on shady slopes and created ice crusts on top of faceted snow on solar aspects.

Between January 14th and 20th, snow fell six out of seven days, culminating on January 20th with strong southwest to northwesterly winds, dense heavy snow and an active avalanche cycle. Snow totals from Big Cottonwood and the Park City side ranged from 7” to 11"" on the 20th, with storm water equivalents of .65"" to 1.04"". The Mill D North SNOTEL site had similar SWE numbers.

January 21st had sunny skies and temperatures ranging from near 10 degrees F into the low 20s.","

We (party of 3) ice climbed in Santaquin Canyon today looking to do Backoff and/or Squash Head.  We opted for Backoff first and arrived at the base around 11:15am.  We climbed and top roped the route.

 

At approximately 12:45pm while on Backoff we heard a rumbling noise from an undetermined direction.  As the sound became louder, we could tell it was an avalanche and it seemed to come from the gully to the north, which is the route called Squash Head.  We quickly wrapped up our session with the concern that Backoff also has similar terrain above it and perhaps another slide could happen on top of us.

 

After getting back to the road we could indeed see that a slide occurred on Squash Head.  The debris pile covered all of the staging area, spilled both down the approach gully and also into the trees off of the staging area.  The debris was dirty snow.  Logs larger than 18” in diameter and 15’ long were in the debris.  The size of the debris appeared it might have been able to burry a person, particularly had they been knocked over by the heavy wet debris.  This slide would have been extremely dangerous to a party on route.  One of our party surveyed the staging area while we spotted from the trees to climber’s left.  He did not notice any signs of other climbers. 

 

One of our party had been in Santaquin last season (2019-02-02) near these routes when a series of avalanches occurred.  Observations from that incident are logged on the UAC site.  Last night I reviewed those observations as well as the forecasts for the days leading up to the slides last year.  My interest in reviewing the previous incident was to determine what the conditions were so that we did not end up in the same situation.  I did not feel that the conditions last year were the similar enough to those today to cause us to change plans.

 

Today’s forecast was predicted to be warm (+45F), and the forecast was accurate to what we felt.  This is very warm for ice climbing, particularly when the route(s) are in known avalanche terrain.  Our rationale for proceeding with our day was that the incident in Feb. 2019 occurred for very different reasons than the conditions we experienced today.  See those reports for more detail. 

 

The weather has been stable for many days prior to today—clear, warm, and moderate wind, but little available snow to transport.  The conditions today did cloud up on our walk in.  My hypothesis is that the snow has been very stable in previous days despite the warmth and sun.  Today the weather was slightly different, warm but cloudy.  This could have warmed north facing snow more than previous days because it was not a clear sky.  The cooler snow on these aspects may have naturally released because of warming from the cloudy sky today.  Another possibility might be a glide avalanche since there are many slabs of rock above the route.  From the ground it was impossible to see the starting zone and therefore any more information about the cause.

This is information is from talking with the Canyons ski patrollers who responded to the accident and a visit to the site by UAC forecasters Evelyn Lees and Brett Kobernik. More details may be added later if it is possible to interview the survivor.

The accident occurred in Dutch Draw, a backcountry area south of the Canyons Resort.

Timothy and his partner were on snowboards. They left through the well marked boundary gate at the top of 9990 Lift and traversed south It is believed both the victim and his partner descended about 150 or 200’ below the ridgeline and stopped near the cliffs. Then Timothy descended the next section first, triggered a slab avalanche. He was caught, carried and buried. Neither he nor his partner were wearing a beacon or had rescue gear.

Rescue: Timothy’s partner immediately headed down to the debris and started searching. As other backcountry travelers in adjacent area came into view, he called out for help, and a total of 8 people arrived. One was sent for help. The other 7 people searched the debris. None of the parties were equipped with beacons or rescue gear. Some skiers popped the baskets off their poles and probed. One struck the victim’s snowboard and they started digging just as 2 Canyons ski patrollers arrived on the scene. Timothy was dug out, and a ski patroller and Timothy’s partner started CPR. They transported the victim to a nearby flat area where a medical helicopter could land and transport the victim to the hospital. The victim was buried about 40 minutes. It is unknown if he died from trauma or asphyxiation.

The victim was carried about 600 vertical feet, strained through small trees, and buried near the toe of the slide. He buried head first downhill, face down, with his head approximately 3 feet below the snow surface in debris that was about 6 to 8 feet deep. The snowboard was broken in half, but held together by some of the material. 

 

email from Jay Torgersen, Flight Paramedic, AirMed

I was on the AirMed team that responded to the Canyons and worked with their Patrol on the side-country accident/fatality yesterday. Our team was made up of Casey Thompson-RN, Troy Stanton-Pilot and myself. Just wanted to pass on to your investigation team what a fantastic job the Canyon’s Patrol did coordinating the initial rescue effort. It was a difficult and potentially dangerous situation that they handled extremely well. It was evident that safety was their number one priority, not just for their own personnel but for those of us called in to assist. They also had to consider the safety of bystanders and the victim’s party who were attempting a partner rescue. There were several variables to consider in the cost versus benefit analysis faced by those running the incident. Having experienced and organized incident commanders with well thought out strategic plans and back-ups allowed the operation to unfold without further incident or harm to all involved. Without addressing the victims own personal preparedness, I don’t think there was anything that could have been done that would have changed the ultimate outcome. The Canyon’s Patrol and the Summit County SO team should be commended for outstanding work performed in a stressful, challenging and extremely difficult environment. Take care and be safe!

This occurred at around 2pm.  While it was overcast at this time and had been intermittently cloudy for the previous few hours it seemed that this slope had received enough sun to make it more reactive than neighboring lines off the cirque.  Additionally there appeared to be wind loading at the top of the line, and possibly in some areas lower down.

On Thursday March 9 we checked the Provo area avalanche forecast and made the decision to go ice-climbing in Santaquin Canyon.

 

On Friday, March 10 we drove from Provo to Santaquin canyon arriving at the gate/parking area at 10:57 AM (based on a text telling my wife I would be losing cell reception soon). It had been raining all morning in Provo but was clear when we parked and started hiking.  We did not check the forecast on the morning of March 10. 

 

We hiked up- 2 ice climbers and one dog. We did the climb as it is typically done- I led both pitches and belayed my partner up from each of the two anchors. Our original plan was to do the typical rappel a short walk up the gulley from the 2nd pitch anchors and drop down by the climb called ""backoff"" but decided instead to go back down the route we had climbed because the dog was just lying on the backpacks below the climb. 

 

I lowered my partner down to the anchors above the first pitch and he clipped directly to the bolts that are several feet up on the cliff wall out of harms way. I pulled the rope up after he was clipped directly to the midpoint anchors and ran it through the master point of the double anchor chains of the 2nd pitch. A brand-new anchor had been installed in 2021.

 

I started rappelling down to my partner and was only about 25' from the anchors right in the dead center of the gully when I heard the insane sound of the avalanche. I looked up to see it coming right at me at high speed and knew I was most likely dead. A second later I was airborne and getting thrown around violently. We estimate that it continued to flow at full bore for somewhere between a minute and a minute thirty. 

 

Most of my experience was luckily staying on the top of the slide getting hammered by debris of all sorts. I felt blackout dizzy a few times but was able to stay conscious enough to keep the rope locked off in my belay device. At one point I was completely buried and watched the few pierces of light turn to complete darkness. After about 5 seconds of complete darkness with the sounds coming through muffled, I registered a big muffled boom and found myself flying up the air in bright daylight again surprised, and a bit horrified but stoked, to come down onto the raging bull again.

 

Once the slide finally stopped, I was shocked I was alive. I yelled for my partner “ARE YOU ALIVE?” and was startled to have him yell back. ""I'M FINE, I WAS OUT OF THE WAY AT THE ANCHOR"". Then he said in a really funny twisted up tone of voice "" WAIT, YOU’RE ALIVE"". 

 

I was surprised to stand up and actually be able to stand up. I could taste blood but assumed with all the impact I had just gone through I couldn't possibly not have broken anything. I got up to find the rope in a tangled mess about 8' below me. I fixed this as fast as I could and rappelled the rest of the way down to my partner. I asked him if my face was messed up & it wasn't. I told him to run the rope through the anchor and we rappelled down the first pitch one at time onto the avalanche debris.

 

At this point being in a crazy headspace I removed one of my ice axes from my harness, briefly contemplating how they could've been imbedded into my body at any point, and started digging for the dog in the spot I thought might be close to where we left the backpacks. We started to pack up what we could and dig for the dog where he had last been seen near the tree.  

 

Suddenly I hear another sound like a commercial airliner start roaring (another avalanche) and yelled ""OH SHIT"". My partner heard me but was so close to the wall that he somehow missed the sound of the 2nd avalanche coming down the gully, but he knew from my reaction what had happened. He ran closer to the wall and out as I ran a path directly out to the same side. He dropped the rope from his shoulders but kept a grasp on a portion of it only to feel the avalanche tugging on it. He let go of it and watched it zip quickly into the 2nd slide. I barely made it off into the trees and could see him safely tucked out of the way.

 

We estimate the 2nd slide went for about 25-30 seconds. Once it stopped, I said to him ""The dog is dead we gotta get the hell outta here, this thing seems like it’s committed to killing us""

    

As we were walking down next to the debris pile, we were shocked to see the backpack next to a tree. We grabbed it and continued our fast hike/ jog down. 

 

Every few minutes I would yell the dog’s name refusing to accept that he was likely dead. Finally at the final turn the dog came ripping around the corner.  (It turns out the dog had been hit by an ice block in Maple Canyon earlier this season and most likely ran when he heard the sound of the first avalanche).

 

We arrived at the truck and paused for a minute to remove our harnesses and threw what gear we had in the back of the truck then continued down the canyon road before getting picked up by another couple in the canyon who were able to drive us down to cell service.

 

I am doing well now with a very sore left knee and right shoulder but no real damage all things considered. 

 

Take homes



	Check the forecast the morning before committing to an objective; and talk to more experienced friends if things seem strange
	Don’t let familiarity with a zone take precedence over avalanche hazard
	Remember that even though we’re on ice and not snow the overhead hazard is very real. In this case there is close to 2,000’ of runout from the upper bowl that funnels over the ice climb
	Take note of changing conditions, in this case rain in/out on the drive and approach to the climb.

Similar slopes nearby had some wind-loading and am guessing this slope was also wind-loaded. It also faces east which is a leeward aspect from the recent northwest winds.

 

The weak layer is a layer of lower-density snow just above the dust crust. I found this weak layer on Thursday in the Catherine's Pass Area, and it is apparently still reactive as other avalanches reported from Saturday are also failing on this weak layer. 

 

We found no other signs of instability such as cracking and it seems you need a denser slab with some wind-loading to make this weak layer reactive.

Generally 25-30cm of new snow fell in upper LCC and Days Fork by 9 am with another 6cm throughout the day. Moderate to strong WNW wind was interacting with terrain features and loading multiple aspects including leeward cliff bases a bit deeper than that. Upon first inspection, NE aspects along the Emma Ridge had about 30-35cm of new snow on top of the brown old snow surface. The initial 10cm of dense snow seemed bonded fairly well to the dust layer and the rest was right-side up and decreasing density. Wind was actively loading intermittently as seen in this pic skiers left Two Dogs.
","This next pocket propagated about 10 meters wide and traveled much faster to the bottom of the slope (Pic 3). It was about 35cm deep and failed at the new/old interface that I had previously considered well bonded. I think the combination of a little thicker slab and steeper slope is what pushed it over the top here. At this point it was time to reconsider our plan for a few reasons. First, I had just ruined much of the good skiing on our run and this might push us into steeper unstable slopes to the left and right. Second, were my partners up for navigating more instability than we originally thought? I was still close enough to the ridge to communicate with them and we decided to continue with the second skier skiing left of all the displaced snow. While I stayed in a safe spot under the cliff, he initiated another dry loose slide that caused him to pull up and let the sluff go by. Now we were more committed and continued ""managing"" our out. Most of the steep terrain had already slid but one pocket still remained to the right. I again entered it high and this one propagated a bit wider and deeper still, 15 meters x 45cm deep (Pic 4, 5).","With most of the main Two Dogs avalanched, we were able to ski one at a time along the flanks without incident and got some quality face shots (Pic 6). In retrospect, I think we pushed our margin for error right up to the line of what should be acceptable. We didn't have to ski the slope. We could have easily chosen a lower slope angle and had fine runs. We chose to ""manage"" it because I have a lot of experience doing this type of thing and we were a strong group. To be fair, I have been doing this type of active ski cutting for over 25 years both in ski areas and the backcountry and did actually manage it properly. But any time you commit to this extra risk you have to acknowledge there is a lot of uncertainty. What if it was a little more stubborn and waited until I was a few more turns into it to release? Or what if my partner didn't pull up and his sluff knocked him over and tweaked his knee? It's made me re-evaluate my goals for any given ski outing and for this I wanted to share more of the details. Avalanche educator Sarah Carpenter recently wrote a nice article in the latest issue of The Avalanche Review that talks specifically about this idea of manageability. She quotes Dave Richards from Alta and its so poignant I'll re-quote. ""...avalanches are not manageable. However, terrain is. And actions are as well. The goal of the backcountry skier is to manage their terrain and actions at all costs.""","What follows is a description of what I consider cutting your margin for error a little too close for comfort. We wanted to ski Two Dogs and discussed what seemed to be a manageable plan to stay high along the cliff base to ski cut the steep rounded pillows on the skiers right. Slope angles right along the cliff base are 39 to 40 degrees. With good visibility that the runout was clear I entered high and pushed some loose snow that got moving along the slick old snow surface. I was surprised with two things. This small dry loose slide didn't propagate into the steeper pockets to the right and that it slowly made it most of the way almost all the way to the bottom (Pic 2). Continuing to think it manageable, I skied into the next pocket along the cliff base. ",18.0,600.0,4800.0,10200.0

From a distance it appears to have failed on a buried persistent weak layer, most likely facets above a rain-crust from late January or early February.

Came up into main porter today and quickly noticed a large crown on the Ice Box about a hundred feet below the ridge, presumably from overnight. Crown appeared to be about 5-6' deep and a few hundred feet wide, but hard to tell from such a distance. Also noted a few dry loose slides high in the Sox's area that did not break into a deeper layer.



(N. Pearson) One of many naturals that went in Porter fork during high PI rate on the eveing of the 13th. This one ran in the corner pocket of iceboxin Main Porter about 100 lower than the ridge. The Majority of this slide had about 4-6 foot crown. Broke all the way around to the northwest facing steep slope with a 2-3 foot crown on average. I estimate this slide to be about 400-600 ft wide. Debris ran down the gully about 1000 ft and deposited in the flats. Takeaway from this and many other very large slides in the area is to activily aviod gullies, be congnisant of overhead hazard that may be 300-1000+ feet above you, and don't trust some of the standard skin tracks in the area. There is a lot of danger in the Porter Fork area in Milcreek. These large slopes are primed and ready to fail if they haven't already done so. There is plenty of snow hanging out on the rest of Icebox that could result in a slide 2-3 times larger.

Snow involved took out the last 2 storms.
This area rolls a bit steeper than where the tracks to the skiers left are.  tracks are after the fact, our party skied before we knew the slide had occurred, could not see from the entry from the ridge.  1st skier in our party skied past the debris, 2nd skier saw that the 1st was not involved.  Remaining 3 skiers went after we conformed that no-one was caught.  I double checked this with a stop and visual search from the crown and saw that no tracks were coming or going into the slide area.
Slide was heard by a solo skier approaching from porter fork.  solo skier reported that one person may have been hit by the dust cloud (unconfirmed).
triggered remotely from approximately 150' away. - one can see the ski tracks looker's left of the crown -
tracks adjacent to slide on both sides were after the fact.  no tracks entering the slide.  Hopefully the responsible party will submit more information.  triggered by a party skiing to the skiers right of the slide.
Occurred after many parties have skied in the area.  Did not investigate the crown, too much hangfire.  Stopped only long enough to ascertain that no one was caught. 
We did an ECT test on the flank at about 1/3 height.  No indications of instabilities.  ECT was negative.  
 
Note:
If this was not triggered by another party, it could have easily been triggered later in the day by my party. I began to initiate a rescue until I saw the 2nd skier in my party skiing next to the debris.  He was able to determine that it was not triggred by the 1st skier without missing a turn.
We did not observe any signs of instability before the slide.
 
 
",,,"Forecaster (Hardesty) Comment: I went up to look at the slide today - the day after it was triggered. Found the weakness to be 1mm facets (picture below) above the Dec 4/5 rain event. Bed surface photo shows where in some places the upper rain crust stepped down 1-2cm on facets above yet another - 15mm - thick rain crust from Dec 2. 
Much of Gobbler's into Porter Fork is thin - total snow depths averaged 3' deep and has well developed facet/crust sandwiches buried 1-2' deep on average. Crown depths ranged from 10"" to just over 2' deep with slope angles (it rolls at the fracture line) to 40+. 
Let's look at Ian McCammon's Lemons for structure within the snowpack. 

	
		Concerning Weakness within 1m of snow surface - Check
	
		Persistent Weak Layer - Check
	
		Weak Layer Thickness less than 10cm - Check (roughly 2cm - see photo)
	
		Grain Size difference 1mm or greater - Check 
	
		Hand Harness Difference Greater than 1 step: Check - facets (4F minus) overlying slab - varied from 1F to Pencil​

 
Now for the $69 dollar question - Why there? - particularly with all the tracks nearby? Good question indeed. Here are a couple thoughts.

	
		The Solstice wind event (strong south/southwest winds) resulted in odd loading patterns...perhaps the slab (1F-Pencil) was more pronounced mid-slope.
	
		The facet/crust sandwich is more of a troublemaker at this elevation (9500') rather than much higher...rain is elevation dependent.
	
		Most of the tracks looker's right came after the the event...and perhaps could have well triggered it themselves had it not previously been remoted.

I started skiing and hit a waist deep powder pocket, which is when I think I triggered the avalanche.
