Judging by my estimated depth I'd think it was the storm snow. I called this a hard slab based on me poking around some wind loaded areas today that had roughly a 1F hard slab overlaying the recent storm snow from 11/28-11/29.\n",

We heard many collapses during the day, and specifically we heard one when we were traveling well away from the ridgeline where we apparently remotely triggered it. And we were approximately 125 feet away from the ridgeline. Upon our second ascent on this skin track we observed an avalanche had occurred in the site noted. Crown was easily 1 meter deep on the left flank. Obviuosly it was a Wind Loaded Hard Slab that broke down into the old snow/new snow interface from the previous snow event earlier in the week. Avalanche ran to the valley floor and up the other side at least 70 feet. HS-ASr-D2. Of note, besides getting widespread collapsing and cracking throughout the day, Cornices were extremely sensitive, reactive and easily triggered without getting near their edges. Collapsing in the NE West Willow Bowl area on the ridgeline dislodged multiple cornices without effort and or intent. No traffic was in any runout zones. \n",

It was estimated to be 300' wide and ran 500' vertically before stopping in the flats.  This would have been an unsurvivable avalanche.\n\nIt was difficult to determine a trigger, however there were snowmobile tracks on the ridgetop adjacent to the slide. The crown spanned aspects from east- northeast and there was some variability in the hardness of the wind slab over the weak layer throughout the crown face. \n\n \n\nThe weak layer was approximately 80cm off of the ground and consisted of a very thin melt freeze crust with small grained facets above and below.  There were sections of the bed surface that were over 1 meter deep. What this tells us is that the weak layer is elevated off of the ground.  What this means for us as backcountry travelers is that the potential for much larger avalanches could be more prevalent this season.\n\n \n\nThis avalanche was reported late in the day on Saturday December 3, 2022. DPS did a fly by and worked with Park City Patrol to determine that there was no one involved. This avalanche occurred in closed terrain within the Park City Ski Area Boundary and resembles backcountry terrain in similar areas. \n\n \n\nAs you travel near ski areas please respect their ski area boundaries. Check out resort uphill policies here. \n\nIf you see or are involved in any avalanches around ski area boundaries please report them to the appropriate rescue organization. \n",

Person appeared to be riding down the Dog Lake Chutes and made a cross slope turn and initiated a wide/substantial Dry Loose Avalanche that dug down to the old snow new snow interface upon descent, and was at least 90 feet wide. Tracks rode out of the debris. The debris piled up to be at least 2 feet if not 3 and ran to the transition. Of note the entire rider's right half of the Main Dog Lake Chute had multiple Natural Dry Loose Avalanches that appeared to be initiating from  the steep North facing cliff bands and these also ran to the transitions. Hand Shears and Tilt Tests confirmed the obvious weakness that only got deeper as the day progressed. Snow fall rates were sustained in the S3 to S4 range for the most of the entire day with HN from 0900 exceeding 6 inches, and the HST 14 inches. Snow was extremely light density and there was good bonding to the old snow/new snow interface as the storm came in Rightside up. Still experiencing isolated collapsing, but as visibility was poor most of the day it was difficult to see any other Avalanche Activity. \n",

        "Comments 1": "We observed significant cracking and collapsing on our ascent. We took a lower angled but brushy approach. We skied a couple of slopes below 30 degrees. Rather than climb back up to exit lower angle slopes we mistakenly decided to ski a steeper slope that we had skied several times this season. The first skier skied 6-8 turns to an island of safety and then the second skier joined the first. The third skier came down from above us to skiers left and skied the slope without incident to a lower ridge which is usually safe. The second skier then followed him down. On his third turn the slope fractured 100' above him and began to move. The first skier yelled avalanche and instructed the second skier to go left. At the same time the slope to the right fractured and slid to the ground. Another slope to our left also released and slid about the same time.\n\nThe second skier was knocked down and I lost sight of him in a cloud of snow as he was carried downhill. I followed him visually down the slope from where I lost sight of him. I yelled to our other partner that I couldn't see him hoping he had a visual. Then I spotted him a couple of hundred feet below me, on a ledge near the left edge of the debris pile, as the snow stopped moving. He lost both skis and broke both safety straps. He took a beating as he was carried through maple and scrub oak. He was pinned to the ground by dense snow around his pack unable to move until he unbuckled his pack. He stood up and found one ski nearby and I located the other ski above him in some scrub oak.\n\nHe described being caught and carried, tumbling in the snow seeing nothing but white until he came to a stop on the surface. He was pummeled by snow and branches as he was carried down the slope. No major injuries occurred but he will be bruised and pulled a hamstring. He thought he was taking his last breath and so did I. It's not a good feeling. We were lucky he was ok and able to ski out. The ridge we skied out was noted to crack more than 20 times on our exit but wasn't steep enough to slide.\n\nWhat did we do wrong? We didn't pay attention to the obvious and significant cracking and collapsing as we skinned up. This was at the same elevation as the avalanche we triggered.  We chose an exit from the mountain that was too steep because we didn't want to hike up to a lower angle exit. We were lulled to sleep by good skiing earlier in the day. We didn't do a proper ski cut before skiing this slope. We didn't fully understand the effects that 4 inches of rain had on the snow pack. We thought the rain would stabilize the snow pack but it completely saturated the snow to the ground making it weaker. We didn't register or heed advice from UAC forecast.\n\nWhat did we do right? We reviewed the UAC forecast before our tour. We skied one at a time utilizing islands of safety above and below the slope that avalanched. We were equipped with beacons, probes and shovels and knew how to use this gear. We practice with our beacons, probes and shovels.  We reported this slide so others can learn from our mistakes. It's embarrassing to admit we screwed up.\n\nIn summary we messed up and were very lucky that things didn't turn out worse. \n\n \n",

I dropped a pole and went to airbag handle but gave one hard stomp with my downhill ski and got lucky. It caught, put me back on my feet and allowed me to ski out of the slide to skiers right.\n\n\n\nBeing able to ski out of this slide was beyond lucky and should not have happened.

Based on the amount of new snow on top of the debris we are guessing it went last night or in the afternoon yesterday. Hard to tell if it was natural or triggered by a near by ski track (skier's left). Starting on the looker's left side of the slide it was about 3.5' deep and got shallower the further looker's right it went down to about 1'. In some places it went to the ground and in other it looked like it was within the old snow. Not crazy huge, but definely enough to bury a person especially considering it dumped right into the gully. Quite a few ski tracks around it. We also had a couple of loud collapses that had our hairs standing on end today. \n\n \n\nSS-U-R2-D2.5-G\n",

I had watched them tumble down the slope for a few hundred vertical and stop. Nothing came of it, so I carried on, but after I came back down to the saddle, I was pretty surprised to see this large slide. Due to the substantial hang fire, I was not willing to investigate much at all. The upper crown looked to vary from 18'-30\" and the far left of the lower crown looked like it was over 48\" probably due to wind loading. The light was very flat all day, which made it almost impossible to get any good photos. Here is the approximate slide path from Google Earth. the light did improve for a few minutes at the end of the day, just enough to show me the extensive debris piles which flowed a good ways down Cutler Creek, and all across the east face. This was from earlier in the storm, as the debris was quite smoothed over from wind and additional snow.\n",

Elevation 7750 ft. HS skiers right crown was 225 cm and on the left was 285 cm.  Judging from snow depth this spot has significant wind loading which contributed to this slide.  this probably happened Saturday or maybe New Years Day because there was 24 cm of new snow on the bed surface. There was a weak layer just above the November facets. This layer was a couple of inches of 4 finger snow with 1 finger snow above and below the weak layer. Stability testing of skiers right hangfire ECTX. The basal facets are definitely gaining strength although that 2 inch layer is slower to heal. \n\nPhotos-\n\n1. Crack in hangfire.\n\n2. Deposition pile.\n\n3. Crack left flank.\n\n4.

We got to a place to transition and started skiing down in the wind towards the east down the ridge to look for a good place to start into the bowl. Wind loading was extreme. Skier 1 traversed safety to another sub ridge and I dropped in for about four or five turns actually before it was cracking up so me and skier 1 traversed the sub ridge even more because it was starting to come at us from above. Skier 3 was blinded and taking pauses in the high winds on the main ridge but was able to navigate the crown and bed surface to us to regroup. I watched the avalanche pick up speed and we skied down investigated the debris field which ran about 2000' vert, snapped small maples and into a small gully...\n\n \n\nI'm glad no one was caught. The wind even without storm snow was fierce, and very difficult to do anything. It pushed the danger scale way up and as a group it was definitely a good thing to have options and it should be noted that this is the first aggressive bowl of the Wellsvilles. Ski cutting into the bowl vs going out the way we came up was the reason this slide was triggered. It's hard to say what could have gone differently. \n",

        "Comments 1": "\nToday we dropped into Greaseball Couloir just north of the summit of Kessler Peak with the plan to ride out Argenta. On our way up, we dug a snowpit to test stability and found no deep instabilities in the snow structure. As we approached the ridge of Kessler we noticed a lot of wind coming over the ridge and depositing on the North face. We did some stability stomps and were unable to get anything to propagate or observe any shooting cracks. As we traversed from the summit of Kessler to the entrance of the line, we started noticing cross loading beneath the top of the couloir which was causing some strange wind pockets and small cornices. To test the stability of the cross loaded surface, I stood back and stomped at the base of a cornice about the size of a small fridge. The cornice broke and dropped onto the slope without causing any propagation on the slope below. Outside the cross loading, the majority of the wind gusts were coming up the couloir and depositing snow onto the East Face of Kessler. Which made us believe that there likely wasn't any widespread wind loading issues in the couloir proper.\n \n\nI descended first and dropped into the hanging bowl, after making a heel side turn, an isolated wind slab broke loose below and above me which knocked me off my feet and took me for a ride. I was able to keep the majority of my body above the snow and was able to radio my partner that I was sliding with the debris. I made swimming motions with my arms and kicked my board to help keep me on top. After about 300 feet, I was able to slow down and stop, while the rest of the debris released below me. After regrouping, we descended the debris. The slope slid about 1,300 feet. \n \n\nMistakes / Learnings: \n\n\n\n-Respect the wind. Even a small \"manageable\" wind pocket can break and carry you a long way in steep terrain with long runouts. \n\n\n\n-Cross loading is serious. I had read the avy forecast and knew that wind was a problem, but I did not anticipate cross loading to be as obvious as a problem, as this is less common in the Wasatch. Lesson learned.\n\n\n\n-Make a ski cut. I think I could have mitigated some hazard had I made a ski cut before dropping onto the hanging snow field.\n\n\n\n",

South to southeast winds were howling by mid day creating sensitive new cornices and windslabs on NW-N-NE slopes. This little test slope was easily spottable from the side and accessible from the top. As I approached the cornice, it failed triggering the slab below which propagated surprisingly 300' wide with some speed and energy. The slope was small so it ended only 100' below in the lower angle treed slope but piled up quite deep. The slope angle directly below the cornice was steep at 39-40 deg. for a short distance. I think it needed this pitch as lower angle slopes were less sensitive and more stubborn. The weak layer was a density inversion at the old snow interface about 30-40cm down. I didnt do any tests in the hangfire as most all of the slope had avalanched but Gagne has a pertinent observation on a nearby slope that highlights this same weakness. \n\nTouchy.\n",

We were loosely following a burried but visible existing skin track. We came around a corner to find a small, steep, and relatively isolated slope under a rock band. The rocks were about 35 feet above us and the slope was 20 feet wide.  After discussing options/precautions, skier 2 (submitter) stayed back in a safe spot while skier 1 stepped out into the slope. Skier 1's steps quickly triggered a slide in the new snow layer--roughly 6\" on average and starting all the way from the rocks above. Skier 1 stayed in place on their feet during the slide then continued across to sub 30 degree terrain just beyond the slope. \n\n \n\nThe slide was 20 feet wide and went 200+ feet downhill. At it's deepest, the new snow layer there was 8\" but was only 3\" up at the rocks. The slope where skier 1 triggered it from was 39 degrees. At it's steepest by the rocks above, we would estimate the slope was nearly 45 degrees. \n\n \n\nOverall the slide was small and the skier had no trouble standing in place while it happened. No movement at all in the 33 degree and 28 degree terrain over ridges on either side. However, we both immeadiately recognized that in larger terrain, the same situation could have been much worse. We double checked our plan and adjusted for extra caution.\n\n \n\nContinued our day and saw no other red flags above this point. However, we were getting a lot of sluffing, cracking, and movement in the snow at much lower elevations on our way out.\n\n \n\nIt was a nice reminder that established skin tracks are not always the best option. On our way out we realized cutting over 250' lower in elevation would have completed avoided this terrain. \n\n \n\n \n",

Likely related to the aspects we chose. As skiers began to venture to the Lake Catherine area, instability quickly became obvious and surprising. Widespread almost certain D1 soft slab activity was found on the E through N slopes above Lake Catherine. \"Almost Certain\" doesn't appropriately describe the reactivity. As I cut a traverse to ski the Sunset doors, I triggered first a D1 soft slab at my feet before the cliff (pictured, skier in photo), and past the cliff, a D1 soft slab broke 50 feet above me, and ran past me, luckily without sweeping me off my feet. (Pictured: crownline photo without the skier - if you can't make out the crown, it runs the width of the photo 8\" deep or so). This is the avalanche I am citing in this report, though another party triggered a similar avalanche from the top of Rocky Pt. Didn't get a photo. \n\n \n\nAs I escaped to non avalanche terrain, I was more than curious to dig. Propagation within the new snow? Blower pow acting as a slab? Sign me up. Snowpit attached. I found that the weak grain in question appeared to be buried stellar dendrites, and I couldn't tell, but maybe some needles were included. In any case, these grains (pictured) reliably produced failures 30cm down on all aspects in handpits. I don't know what changed within the new snow to create this instability, as the snowpack is otherwise rightside up. It should be noted, however, that, for the moment, these avalanches can be triggered remotely; are not limited to breaking at our feet. My hackles are up. \n",

Not much wind on the way up, but at the very top, the wind was cranking over the ridge from the southwest, transporting more snow. While moving across the very top of the Draw a small storm slab pulled out and ran loose slough past me well down into the draw out of sight (no signs of people or tracks into the draw at that time). We decided to ski CSR mostly on the ridge itself due to the sensitivity of things. Many small sloughs were running even there on lower angle, and some more connected small pieces would run as well, and then this big, well-connected slide was triggered when partner pulled up above a rollover that got a bit steeper below. It sympathetically triggered another big piece around a small subridge as well. Ran down some few hundred vert through trees below us and out of sight. It did not hit the skin track or anyone below. We expected localized new snow instabilities, but not these well connected pieces and full-go storm slabs. \n",

Heavy snow around New Year's produced many large avalanches on the same PWL. Since then the snowpack has gained considerable strength and in most areas the snowpack is very deep - up to 200 cms or more. This avalanche failed in a shallower snowpack area, on a slope with a steep convexity that is subject to heavy wind loading. A stability test performed on a nearby slope produced no results.

The angle kicks up at the very top and realizing this I made a kick turn to bail to the windward side - as I was approaching the crest, I was conscience of the fact that my weight would likely set off a wind slab and on literally my last step to the ridge it did just that - the snow dropped Out from under my feet and I awkwardly rode the slab (heel lifters up) roughly 20 ft down to where the angle mellows out and came to a halt standing up. Looking back up, it looked like the crown was about a foot at its deepest and 25-30' wide. In hindsight, ski crampons and sticking to the windward side would have been the safer option and had the terrain below/ adjacent been steeper and more connected, I wouldn't have chosen this route up at all.

The group was familiar with recent forecasts and discussed impact of the wind multiple times but opted to continue with original objective after *very* casual observations along the skin track didn't expose activity.\n\n- A few tens of yards of climbing could have made the difference in terrain. Because we stopped short it was necessary to make a small traverse to the safer high ground, but doing so meant crossing above an obvious trap. Transitioning a bit further ahead would have kept us out of the gully and on safer terrain from the start.\n\n- The transition had thin cover in places and exposed rocks. Could have noted the weak point and taken it into account.\n\n \n\nClose call and humbling for sure.\n\n\n",

No tracks were noted in the area and we were now confident that nobody was buried in the avalanche. At this point we called Alta Ski Patrol to notify them of the avalanche and inform them that we had performed a transceiver search with no results.

At one point near the ridge into E facing Mill A, we backed off from walking across on particularly rounded pillow of snow, and then triggered the slide remotely from about 20' away while walking away from the open slope across a thin spot. The slide ran at least 1000' vertical, produced a dust cloud, and appeared to shake some big trees. \n\n \n\nAdding this text-only observation a day late because in hindsight it seems like the avalanche could have failed in a radiation-recrystalization or other NSF/crust combo that developed on 1/26. Initially we assumed it failed in pooled graupel, but the steep, planar slope seems more likely to bear some RR etc. than pooled graupel. No pics and no actual forensics because the light was bad and we were above the crown; so it's really just a hunch. But it seems like in some places there's complexity in the upper snowpack right now that folks (like me) don't always factor in, or dig down to evaluate, when they're mostly thinking about windslabs.

While skinning up towards Pole-line/Cardiff pass, we noticed a small avalanche on the southwest side of the Flagstaff shoulder with one ski track entering the crown, and we were unable to see any ski tracks exiting the debris or slope. We shifted directions towards the avalanche, and once at the bottom still could not see any tracks exiting. Despite the small size of the avalanche, we were concerned about a potential hangup in the trees within the path for the involved party. We decided to send two from our group of 5 up to perform a transceiver signal search because it appeared that the individual may have been traveling alone. The remaining group members stayed in the flats, keeping eyes on the hanging snow above, and called Alta Central to inform them of the situation, so Alta Ski Patrol could standby if the signal search yielded results. We turned our beacons to search at the toe of the debris, and continued to switchback up the slope, spacing out ~50 feet. The debris in the open snow, for the most part, was not deep enough to bury a human. On the trees there was debris piled up to 7 feet deep.\n\n \n\nAfter we reached the stauchwall(roughly) we were finally able to see a ski track exiting to the skier's right, through the trees, traversing far out on the slope away from the avalanche. Given the traversing nature of the track, it was almost impossible to see from a downhill angle. At this point, we put our transceivers back into send, and communicated the info back down to the rest of our party below so they could communicate back to Alta Central. Out of an abundance of caution, we sent one skier up to the uppermost trees, the last point where anyone involved in the avalanche could have been pinned. It seemed that the involved party had indeed arrested, pinned, or otherwise stopped against these trees, and then skied out. Hard to tell exactly, but this is my best guess. From here I traversed over to the crown to perform a quick profile, then skied back down to the rest of the group. Picture of the trees from uphill included below.

This slide failed as a slab of wind drifted snow on a layer of small grain facets above a solar crust. The slab was between 10-20\" deep. While it is hard to tell if it failed on small grain facets that were formed by radiation recrystallization, the setup seems. Small grain facets exist below the crust as well. Radiation recrystallization was occurring on the surface above the crown. \n\nNotes from Tim: \nThis morning before work I got in a quick Beartrap Aspens lap. From the ridge summit of Aspens, around 8800 feet, I noticed a large southeast-facing slide off of the West Willow Ridgeline into Mule Hollow. I've skied that aspect and area several times this year, but in less sensitive snowpack conditions, and was personally surprised to see a slide there, especially since the WBSkiing app has this area labeled white, aka not steep enough to slide. It's a good lesson to use the app only as general guideline when observing slope aspects and steepness. \n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say the slide is a few hundred feet long and wide, and several feet deep. Based on where I was standing on the lower ridge summit below, I'd guess the cause was natural due to heavy wind loading from the most recent storm, and that this slide probably happened over the weekend. I did not notice any tracks going in, or near, the slide path, so I did not feel it was necessary to ski into Mule Hollow and do a proper beacon search. If I had seen tracks going into the slide, I probably would have done so. \n \n\nLooking forward to the snowpack healing up again to sneak in some bigger lines. Stay safe people.  \n",

We rode east, south, and west facing slopes and actually found the best riding on south facing slopes.  \n\n \n\nOn the way out we started seeing wet sluffs on south facing slopes with some roller balls (see pic 3)\n\n \n\nWe also noticed two very large avalanches up Wood Camp on Ham Hill (south facing slopes at 7000 and 8400 feet.  We could not get pictures of these slides but they would be very interesting to get a closer look at.\n",

        "Comments 1": "Started the tour today under cloudy skies that soon turned to heavy snowfall of approximately 1 inch per hour. Had a route planned to climb and to ski what we believed to be safe and protected from the recent winds. We had discussed the possible danger, and wind slabs were the top of the list to look out for. The planned climbing route is one I had used a few times in years past, but had most often used as a descent route. As I was climbing I noticed the wind cross loading slopes well above us, and we discussed the route that we planned to ski as it may have been in that zone. But we did not discuss the climbing route as we were not seeing much wind transport in that area. \n\n \n\nThe initial ascent route was in a tight creek bottom. Anything with some south aspect had rollerballed and had a stout crust from the day before. Just a few feet away north facing felt soft, with a slight density inversion 6-8\" down. The skin track varied from crust stout enough to not break through, up to 8 inches of ski penetration. The light was very flat, and it was difficult to tell uphill from down in many places and slope steepness was hard to judge. This led to the mistake of being on this slope. \n\n \n\nFrom looking at the map earlier in the tour, I had planned to be up out of the creek bottom and onto a north facing bench sooner, But with very few visual clues and the intense snowfall rate, I had missed this turn. As we were skinning up the drainage, I noticed the slope get steeper but struggled to plan the track due to the flat light. I could see some brush ahead and misestimated the slope angle between myself and the brush. As I climbed towards it, it became too steep to skin that direction so I stopped to kick turn to my right. As I completed my kick turn I heard a loud crack and the slope started to move. \n\n \n\nAs I had already changed direction my ski started to turn downhill and I was able to stay *mostly* on top of the debris. My partner, who was still facing uphill as the slide started, was sucked backwards, skis pulling under. I yelled for him to swim right as I was getting ready to go over the top of him. Luckily, the slope angle had gently backed off and the slide started to slow. When the snow stopped moving, I was able to take off skis and stand up. My partner was partially buried, waist deep with his head facing uphill, but downhill from his skis. His skis were under enough snow that I had to dig them out to release his bindings. \n\n \n\nThe maximum crown depth was three feet, and averaged around 18 inches. Crown was 45-50 feet wide and total slide distance from crown to toe was about 60 feet. The wind slab was very cohesive and stayed in large blocks through the avalanche. It entrained a shocking amount of snow for the size. The crown was on a slope angle of 35 degrees, and broke about 5 feet above us, right at a convex roll. The angle of the slope at the toe was 20 degrees. \n\n \n\nWe were very lucky that this happened on a slope with overall convexity with the slope angle backing off gently. Many places in the creek bottom we we're traveling through had sharp concave sections that could easily have been terrain traps. I am disappointed that I underestimated the amount of snow that had been loading in this zone over the previous days. Being fairly low elevation and in a tight drainage I mistakenly thought that the area hadn't seen much wind. I am also disappointed that I failed to recognize the windslab, and mistook it for a supportable crust. I don't think I had on my \"avalanche eyes\" at this point due to complacency and ease of travel. Had I been paying better attention to the route, and doing small checks of the snow along the way, I may have seen earlier signs of slab. One pole was lost, overall a very cheap lesson. \n\n \n\n \n",

Upon investigation, it became apparent that the bed surface contained intact buried stellar crystals, which are likely the culprit, though I'm not sure. I didn't dig. I didn't see any surface hoar or faceted grains. The avalanche did not seem to be wind related in nature. I also observed many dry loose point releases today, but none featuring a crown line, or apparent propagation. I'm not getting too excited, as I bet this instability is isolated and won't last. \n",

I've never seen a slide path in the canyon before in the 5 years I've lived in it. Snow depth is around 2-3 feet on those slopes and it looks to have broke near the ground, probably 18\" crown or so with a 100+ foot width. The slope angle is 40+ degrees on these slopes, so a very steep angle. \n\n \n\nThis is notable because during the winters this area is an active one for bow hunters, I've regularly seen them on these aspects hiking in the snow. The runout was around 500 feet through a few terrain traps. There's still a lot of snow on the northerly aspects below 6k feet, hikers and hunters need to be aware. Unclear what triggered this slide, possibly a large animal, we have a few herd of deer around. \n\n \n\n \n\nForecaster Notes:  Thank you for the report- we have seen a few other animal triggered (?) slides in the foothills this winter (Big Cottonwood, Ogden). We went to look at this avalanche on February 20th. It stood out as unique and we wanted to see what the lower elevation snowpack looked like prior to the next storm.  This avalanche was most likely triggered by a deer on a layer of rounding facets above a melt freeze crust. It averaged 12\" deep, 18\" at the deepest on a 35 degree slope. The avalanche was 30' wide and between the 2 slides ran about 300' down the slope. It was difficult to see the debris as it dispersed into the trees.  I believe this was from an easterly canyon wind that cross loaded the slope. We did not go to the crown face as there were  cracks above the crown and not worth the risk.\n\n \n\nPhoto 1- Upper avalanche\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nPhoto 2- Lower avalanche\n\n\n\n \n\nPhoto 3- Snowpit\n\n\n",

First boarder hugged the trees on the skiers left of the main run and had a clean run to the basin. Second boarder cut a bit skiers right into a wind loaded run and immediately set off the slab. They took a few more turns and cut left, avoiding the bulk of the slide. They made it safely to the bottom without getting caught. The slide ran for about 200 feet. \n\n \n\nFrom the party that triggered the avalanche (KL)\n\n \n\nAfter watching a group safely descend Upper Days, my buddy dropped in to Two Dogs & rode out safely. I dropped in next, further skiers right into slightly steeper terrain. On my 2nd turn I triggered the edge of a large wind slab . Fortunately I was able to ride out & veer skiers left out of the slide path. It picked up some speed part way down the slope & ran a few hundred feet, definitely large enough to catch & carry. The avy report was dead on this morning & in hindsight given the wind slab risk & strong winds on the ridge, we should have stuck to lower slope angles.\n\n \n",

None of us had done this approach before. We could see skyline through the trees and decided that two of our party would wait a safe distance back in the trees while two of us checked out the entrance onto the ridge. The two that continued realized that we were high as soon as we popped out of the trees and briefly talked about options, including going back down into the trees and retreating lower. However, the top of the ridge was one good kick turn away and we got sucked into that \"it’s so close” trap.\n\nAs my partner took some steps toward the top of the ridge I actually backed away even further and started getting pretty nervous but only said, “be careful, that looks wind loaded.” My partner was focused on a cornice on his left until he said, “oh, this is where the wind is dropping all the snow”. I had turned around and yelled to our other members to “not come up here”. I had decided we really should retreat, but I was too late and my partner yelled “slide”, and I turned back and saw the wind slab below the ridge break all around him. I tried to ski out to the side as I was on the very edge of where it propagated, but it hit me almost immediately. It broke probably 25’ wide and ran 50-60’; enough to take both of us for a short ride. My partner stopped at a tree probably 20’ down and I stopped at a tree 30’ down.\n\nNo burial, and no injuries besides a bruise. We did lose some poles. Once we determined everyone was ok we retreated and had a good debriefing and discussion of the traps we fell into.\n\nThings we did right were space our party out as we became unsure of the route and terrain.\n\nThings we did wrong were not turn around when we realized we had not approached the ridge the way we had intended. We knew we were in the wrong place, but got sucked into the feeling that it was just “right there”. The cornice drew our awareness away from the lower soft wind slab deposited below the ridge. Also, things can happen so quickly. Decisions can be made without fully understanding you are making them. Our group had a good dynamic and good communication generally, but in this moment we just didn’t take enough time. By the time I had processed my discomfort with the danger of continuing onto the ridge, it was too late. I needed to speak up immediately and more clearly. We should have returned and told the other two of our party the situation. I’m certain that would have changed our forward momentum and given us the time to make a better decision. We had been in pretty benign terrain all day, and had intended to keep it that way, but it only took 30 seconds for that to get away from us.\n\n",

I skied first, and at about 8000' noticed a very long crack propagating to the south. About 10 seconds later I saw a large powder cloud racing down the south side of the bowl, very far to the skier's right of my line. On our way back down to Franklin Basin, we had improved visibility and were able to check out the crown, which averaged a bit over 2 feet deep.

As I was about 5 feet above the apex of the convexity the avalanche released, propogated around 50 feet wide and ran for 20-30 vertical feet. Non-consequential avalanche in relatively non-consequential terrain, however there was still a significant amount of snow(~4feet) stacked up on the tree immediately below the crown. The slab varied in hardness but was generally 1F. This avalanche along with numerous other smaller ones that we triggered today were isolated to ridgelines and other areas more exposed to the wind. Below the ridgelines, we found awesome powder skiing in undisturbed light density snow. Throughout the tour, we found said light density snow on the surface to be incredibly slippery, some of the crystals rimed, some not. I will be more suscpicious of sensitive storm/wind slabs as the next load comes tonight given this info. We toured from white pine, into redpine, and exiting maybird, traveling on almost every aspect other than south. Observed cracking, and some smaller avalanches all over anywhere that was exposed to the wind.\n",

I figured the terrain wasn't too consequential, it has no terrain traps.\n\n \n\nI intentionally ski cut the middle Race Start, skiing left towards the spur between middle and upper. The whole middle bowl ripped from the top and luckily I planned my ski cut well enough. The slope shattered around me but I was easily able to ski 15 feet left to safety on the spur.\n\n \n\nThe wind slab broke about 2' deep, 100' wide and ran 450'.

From the ridge we set the remaining boot pack to the top of rainbow peak. Along the way, the top 4 inches of new snow showed signs of instability (cracking, blocking) on the windward side of the ridge. Knowing there would be a good chance of a wind slab over graupel on Rainbow Peak chute I cut the top of the slope. This cut released an avalanche that slide the entire length of the chute. After cutting the slope I entered a island of safety to the right of the slope as the avalanche passed by. Only once the slide settled did I continue cautiously to the bottom.\n \n\nI think this episode shows the importance of identifying zones of safety before riding through avalanche terrain and cutting the top of a slope before entering the terrain below. While zones of safety and slope cuts are NOT a solution in avalanche terrain they do play a small part in mitigating risks.

The initial release was a small wind slab at the ridge, and when it traveled down slope it released this larger pocket, failing on a graupel layer. This type of avalanche was ubiquitous around the range on many aspects above 8500'. There was evidence of another similar slide up higher in the drainage just below the headwall on the east facing slopes of the East Twin in Mary Ellen Gulch. This slide was remote triggered over 300m away due to mitigation work in the neighboring drainage of Mineral Basin (48 hours prior). There was also buried debris all throughout the drainage. The natural cycle, and ensuing AE and AS triggered avalanches during and following the week's storm is impressive. A truly widespread problem in the technical sense of the word.\n\nPhotos:\n\n1. Sinners SE Profile and Avalanche SS-ASc-R2D1.5-I\n\n2. Same slide different angle.\n\n3. Upper Mary Ellen Gulch SS-ABr-R3D1.5-I.

The avalanche appears to have stepped down as a result of some sort of dry loose avalanche triggered above. The avalanche likely ran on the graupel layer, which my team and I observed in a snow pit lower in the drainage, but I'm not sure. Wind seems to have also played a role in loading the particular area.  \n",

The slide released a deeper pocket possibly 18\" deep skier's left likely on pooled grapuel below steep rocky feature, which ran roughly 200' on the left side of skier's tracks before piling up on gully terrain feature. Ski tracks weren't overrun as they were on lower angle terrain/subtle ridge around which the slides split. I didn't realize slides had released until I was stopped in a safe zone and saw powder cloud and debris coming to a stop. Didn't see many other signs of instability though there were occasionally high precip rates and enough wind for significant transport. Fortunate to have found the instability on a less exposed slope. Snow was 5 stars so we backed off the slope angles and enojyed the rest of the day.   \n",

Fullmer: SS-N(C)-R3-D2.5/3-I\n\nWe skied The Spire trees and on our way out spotted this natural. It seemed to have gone today, but may have been yesterday after snowfall ceased. I suspect that today's sun/wind caused a piece of the massive cornices above this to break and triggered this avalanche. In a photo I circled what looked like where the cornice gouged through the snow. As near as I could tell, the crown was 4-5'. It looks like the bed surface is the new/old snow interface before the beginning of last week's storm(s). Active loading today on this slope as winds continued to ramp up.  \nIt looks to have run .25 miles and approx. 700 vert. ft. \n\nI saw the other reported large naturals. Sobering day and lots to think about as the next storm rolls in. \n\nDanny:\n\n \n\nSean R: Spotted a recent natural wind slab off the ridge between rainbow peak and dog dish from Scotties.

We sent one skier down without incident. I was second and took a line a few yards away from the first skiers line. I saw a lower slope angle and thought I was taking a safer route. After my second turn I saw a shooting crack at my ski tip, fell, and was carried about 10 yards down slope. The lower angle slope was actually a wind loaded pillow. I wasn't buried, recovered just fine, and skied the rest of the way out. \n",

All of us at the Utah Avalanche Center has had our own close calls and know how easy it is to make mistakes. Here are some take-a-ways from this accident:\n\n\n\tBoth brothers carried an avalanche transceiver, shovel, and probe, along with airbag backpacks and radios for communication.\n\tSnowmobiles are very useful tools during an avalanche rescue because they allow someone to cover long distances quickly; however, they also cause electro-magnetic interference with transceivers. Identifying and mitigating this interference is crucial. The current recommendation is to be 3 meters away from a snowmobile when searching. They can be used in the signal search phase of a rescue, but you need to stop occasionally move 3 meters away from the snowmobile. If there is no signal, return to the sled and change locations.\n\tAvalanche airbags can limit burial depth but are much less effective in terrain traps. Additionally, terrain traps tend to cause deep burials because the avalanche debris often accumulates deeper than it would otherwise. Deep burials are very hard to survive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAvalanche probes are delicate pieces of equipment and most are generally less than 3 meters long. One piece of equipment the group found very valuable was a Pieps iProbe, an electronic probe that can detect a transceiver signal. Without having a probe strike for some time, this tool helped direct their digging efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAlways only to expose one person to avalanche terrain at one time. It was very lucky in this case that both riders were not buried.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n",

The avalanche ran to the flat below and had chest freezer-size debris chunks.\n\n \n\nSeeing this slide really drove home being aware of what is above you when you are in big terrain.\n",

It appears to be skier triggered as there were some tracks adjacent to the slope that slid, as well as what appears to be a track going into the slope at the top.\n\n \n\nSimilar slopes nearby had some wind-loading and am guessing this slope was also wind-loaded. It also faces east which is a leeward aspect from the recent northwest winds.\n\n \n\nThe weak layer is a layer of lower-density snow just above the dust crust. I found this weak layer on Thursday in the Catherine's Pass Area, and it is apparently still reactive as other avalanches reported from Saturday are also failing on this weak layer. \n\n \n\nWe found no other signs of instability such as cracking and it seems you need a denser slab with some wind-loading to make this weak layer reactive.\n",

It was estimated to be 300' wide and ran 500' vertically before stopping in the flats.  This would have been an unsurvivable avalanche.\n\nIt was difficult to determine a trigger, however there were snowmobile tracks on the ridgetop adjacent to the slide. The crown spanned aspects from east- northeast and there was some variability in the hardness of the wind slab over the weak layer throughout the crown face. \n\n \n\nThe weak layer was approximately 80cm off of the ground and consisted of a very thin melt freeze crust with small grained facets above and below.  There were sections of the bed surface that were over 1 meter deep. What this tells us is that the weak layer is elevated off of the ground.  What this means for us as backcountry travelers is that the potential for much larger avalanches could be more prevalent this season.\n\n \n\nThis avalanche was reported late in the day on Saturday December 3, 2022. DPS did a fly by and worked with Park City Patrol to determine that there was no one involved. This avalanche occurred in closed terrain within the Park City Ski Area Boundary and resembles backcountry terrain in similar areas. \n\n \n\nAs you travel near ski areas please respect their ski area boundaries. Check out resort uphill policies here. \n\nIf you see or are involved in any avalanches around ski area boundaries please report them to the appropriate rescue organization. \n",

Person appeared to be riding down the Dog Lake Chutes and made a cross slope turn and initiated a wide/substantial Dry Loose Avalanche that dug down to the old snow new snow interface upon descent, and was at least 90 feet wide. Tracks rode out of the debris. The debris piled up to be at least 2 feet if not 3 and ran to the transition. Of note the entire rider's right half of the Main Dog Lake Chute had multiple Natural Dry Loose Avalanches that appeared to be initiating from  the steep North facing cliff bands and these also ran to the transitions. Hand Shears and Tilt Tests confirmed the obvious weakness that only got deeper as the day progressed. Snow fall rates were sustained in the S3 to S4 range for the most of the entire day with HN from 0900 exceeding 6 inches, and the HST 14 inches. Snow was extremely light density and there was good bonding to the old snow/new snow interface as the storm came in Rightside up. Still experiencing isolated collapsing, but as visibility was poor most of the day it was difficult to see any other Avalanche Activity. \n",

One of our crews hats blew off and I went to fetch it and stabbed it about 8' from the cornice edge. \n\n \n\nI looked down the cornice and saw no one below and half thoughtlessly gave it a minor tap with my pole. The cornice broke back about 1' from the edge and propagated up and downslope for about 50' feet in the last couple days wind deposit. The avalanche then ran for about 100' downslope and ended in the pines. \n \n\nSeveral crews have skied this north slope in the past week. There were at least 3 new ski paths down this steep north facing slope with regular cornices. This is at least the second skier caused avalanche on this slope in the past 8 days.\n",

This made for an adequate sliding surface for this relatively soft slab to run on given a steep enough slope. \n\n \n\nThis terrain is somewhat complicated and sits above a deep gully that could easily pile up debris and even a small avalanche would be capable of burying a person under an immense amount of snow. \n",

I have seen this slope release multiple times. It seems to have the right combination of convex roll leading into a steeper section (35-38 degrees) along with terrain driven winds that must deposit close to the loading point on the convexity. Its a short shot, but can be dangerous as it drains into some trees. \n\n \n\nIt was the end of my day, and I made a tired and lazy decision that I was high enough up on the ridge to cut the slope. \n\n \n\nThe slope broke above me at the new snow old surface interface, then stepped down about 8-6\" onto facets above what I believe is the old dry spell layer. \n\n \n\nI was able to carry momentum and ski off to the north. \n\n \n\nThere was a small amount of hangfire left at the crown slope convexity, but not enough to worry me, so I went back to take a look and investigate the snow layering. \n\n \n\nI made a really bad terrain management call, but this slide shows the fragility of the snowpack and the tricky layering we are experiencing. \n\n \n\nI added a pic of some slides/releases on the Lomond headwall. \n\n \n\n \n",

I'm guessing it may have happened late in the afternoon and it sure looks to be sled triggered with tracks going into the slide from both the top and from the side.  The avalanche failed on the November weak sugary snow and is 2-4' deep.  Interesting that in some places the avalanche broke down at the ground level exposing rocks and bushes.  This slope fits the characteristic of other avalanches in the surrounding area.  It is wind loaded and on the north side of the compass.\n",

This first slide in the Grizzly Cup released naturally sometime overnight or early morning. SS-N-R1-D1.5-I.

Rather than climb back up to exit lower angle slopes we mistakenly decided to ski a steeper slope that we had skied several times this season. The first skier skied 6-8 turns to an island of safety and then the second skier joined the first. The third skier came down from above us to skiers left and skied the slope without incident to a lower ridge which is usually safe. The second skier then followed him down. On his third turn the slope fractured 100' above him and began to move. The first skier yelled avalanche and instructed the second skier to go left. At the same time the slope to the right fractured and slid to the ground. Another slope to our left also released and slid about the same time.\n\nThe second skier was knocked down and I lost sight of him in a cloud of snow as he was carried downhill. I followed him visually down the slope from where I lost sight of him. I yelled to our other partner that I couldn't see him hoping he had a visual. Then I spotted him a couple of hundred feet below me, on a ledge near the left edge of the debris pile, as the snow stopped moving. He lost both skis and broke both safety straps. He took a beating as he was carried through maple and scrub oak. He was pinned to the ground by dense snow around his pack unable to move until he unbuckled his pack. He stood up and found one ski nearby and I located the other ski above him in some scrub oak.\n\nHe described being caught and carried, tumbling in the snow seeing nothing but white until he came to a stop on the surface. He was pummeled by snow and branches as he was carried down the slope. No major injuries occurred but he will be bruised and pulled a hamstring. He thought he was taking his last breath and so did I. It's not a good feeling. We were lucky he was ok and able to ski out. The ridge we skied out was noted to crack more than 20 times on our exit but wasn't steep enough to slide.\n\nWhat did we do wrong? We didn't pay attention to the obvious and significant cracking and collapsing as we skinned up. This was at the same elevation as the avalanche we triggered.  We chose an exit from the mountain that was too steep because we didn't want to hike up to a lower angle exit. We were lulled to sleep by good skiing earlier in the day. We didn't do a proper ski cut before skiing this slope. We didn't fully understand the effects that 4 inches of rain had on the snow pack. We thought the rain would stabilize the snow pack but it completely saturated the snow to the ground making it weaker. We didn't register or heed advice from UAC forecast.\n\nWhat did we do right? We reviewed the UAC forecast before our tour. We skied one at a time utilizing islands of safety above and below the slope that avalanched. We were equipped with beacons, probes and shovels and knew how to use this gear. We practice with our beacons, probes and shovels.  We reported this slide so others can learn from our mistakes. It's embarrassing to admit we screwed up.\n\nIn summary we messed up and were very lucky that things didn't turn out worse. \n\n \n",

I had watched them tumble down the slope for a few hundred vertical and stop. Nothing came of it, so I carried on, but after I came back down to the saddle, I was pretty surprised to see this large slide. Due to the substantial hang fire, I was not willing to investigate much at all. The upper crown looked to vary from 18'-30\" and the far left of the lower crown looked like it was over 48\" probably due to wind loading. The light was very flat all day, which made it almost impossible to get any good photos. Here is the approximate slide path from Google Earth. the light did improve for a few minutes at the end of the day, just enough to show me the extensive debris piles which flowed a good ways down Cutler Creek, and all across the east face. This was from earlier in the storm, as the debris was quite smoothed over from wind and additional snow.\n",

Elevation 7750 ft. HS skiers right crown was 225 cm and on the left was 285 cm.  Judging from snow depth this spot has significant wind loading which contributed to this slide.  this probably happened Saturday or maybe New Years Day because there was 24 cm of new snow on the bed surface. There was a weak layer just above the November facets. This layer was a couple of inches of 4 finger snow with 1 finger snow above and below the weak layer. Stability testing of skiers right hangfire ECTX.

Skier 1 traversed safety to another sub ridge and I dropped in for about four or five turns actually before it was cracking up so me and skier 1 traversed the sub ridge even more because it was starting to come at us from above. Skier 3 was blinded and taking pauses in the high winds on the main ridge but was able to navigate the crown and bed surface to us to regroup. I watched the avalanche pick up speed and we skied down investigated the debris field which ran about 2000' vert, snapped small maples and into a small gully...\n\n \n\nI'm glad no one was caught. The wind even without storm snow was fierce, and very difficult to do anything. It pushed the danger scale way up and as a group it was definitely a good thing to have options and it should be noted that this is the first aggressive bowl of the Wellsvilles. Ski cutting into the bowl vs going out the way we came up was the reason this slide was triggered. It's hard to say what could have gone differently. \n",

On our way up, we dug a snowpit to test stability and found no deep instabilities in the snow structure. As we approached the ridge of Kessler we noticed a lot of wind coming over the ridge and depositing on the North face. We did some stability stomps and were unable to get anything to propagate or observe any shooting cracks. As we traversed from the summit of Kessler to the entrance of the line, we started noticing cross loading beneath the top of the couloir which was causing some strange wind pockets and small cornices. To test the stability of the cross loaded surface, I stood back and stomped at the base of a cornice about the size of a small fridge. The cornice broke and dropped onto the slope without causing any propagation on the slope below. Outside the cross loading, the majority of the wind gusts were coming up the couloir and depositing snow onto the East Face of Kessler. Which made us believe that there likely wasn't any widespread wind loading issues in the couloir proper.\n \n\nI descended first and dropped into the hanging bowl, after making a heel side turn, an isolated wind slab broke loose below and above me which knocked me off my feet and took me for a ride. I was able to keep the majority of my body above the snow and was able to radio my partner that I was sliding with the debris. I made swimming motions with my arms and kicked my board to help keep me on top. After about 300 feet, I was able to slow down and stop, while the rest of the debris released below me. After regrouping, we descended the debris. The slope slid about 1,300 feet. \n \n\nMistakes / Learnings: \n\n\n\n-Respect the wind. Even a small \"manageable\" wind pocket can break and carry you a long way in steep terrain with long runouts. \n\n\n\n-Cross loading is serious. I had read the avy forecast and knew that wind was a problem, but I did not anticipate cross loading to be as obvious as a problem, as this is less common in the Wasatch. Lesson learned.\n\n\n\n-Make a ski cut. I think I could have mitigated some hazard had I made a ski cut before dropping onto the hanging snow field.\n\n\n\n",

This little test slope was easily spottable from the side and accessible from the top. As I approached the cornice, it failed triggering the slab below which propagated surprisingly 300' wide with some speed and energy. The slope was small so it ended only 100' below in the lower angle treed slope but piled up quite deep. The slope angle directly below the cornice was steep at 39-40 deg. for a short distance. I think it needed this pitch as lower angle slopes were less sensitive and more stubborn. The weak layer was a density inversion at the old snow interface about 30-40cm down. I didnt do any tests in the hangfire as most all of the slope had avalanched but Gagne has a pertinent observation on a nearby slope that highlights this same weakness. \n\nTouchy.\n",

We were loosely following a burried but visible existing skin track. We came around a corner to find a small, steep, and relatively isolated slope under a rock band. The rocks were about 35 feet above us and the slope was 20 feet wide.  After discussing options/precautions, skier 2 (submitter) stayed back in a safe spot while skier 1 stepped out into the slope. Skier 1's steps quickly triggered a slide in the new snow layer--roughly 6\" on average and starting all the way from the rocks above. Skier 1 stayed in place on their feet during the slide then continued across to sub 30 degree terrain just beyond the slope. \n\n \n\nThe slide was 20 feet wide and went 200+ feet downhill. At it's deepest, the new snow layer there was 8\" but was only 3\" up at the rocks. The slope where skier 1 triggered it from was 39 degrees. At it's steepest by the rocks above, we would estimate the slope was nearly 45 degrees. \n\n \n\nOverall the slide was small and the skier had no trouble standing in place while it happened. No movement at all in the 33 degree and 28 degree terrain over ridges on either side. However, we both immeadiately recognized that in larger terrain, the same situation could have been much worse. We double checked our plan and adjusted for extra caution.\n\n \n\nContinued our day and saw no other red flags above this point. However, we were getting a lot of sluffing, cracking, and movement in the snow at much lower elevations on our way out.\n\n \n\nIt was a nice reminder that established skin tracks are not always the best option. On our way out we realized cutting over 250' lower in elevation would have completed avoided this terrain. \n\n \n\n \n",

Likely related to the aspects we chose. As skiers began to venture to the Lake Catherine area, instability quickly became obvious and surprising. Widespread almost certain D1 soft slab activity was found on the E through N slopes above Lake Catherine. \"Almost Certain\" doesn't appropriately describe the reactivity. As I cut a traverse to ski the Sunset doors, I triggered first a D1 soft slab at my feet before the cliff (pictured, skier in photo), and past the cliff, a D1 soft slab broke 50 feet above me, and ran past me, luckily without sweeping me off my feet. (Pictured: crownline photo without the skier - if you can't make out the crown, it runs the width of the photo 8\" deep or so). This is the avalanche I am citing in this report, though another party triggered a similar avalanche from the top of Rocky Pt. Didn't get a photo. \n\n \n\nAs I escaped to non avalanche terrain, I was more than curious to dig. Propagation within the new snow? Blower pow acting as a slab? Sign me up. Snowpit attached. I found that the weak grain in question appeared to be buried stellar dendrites, and I couldn't tell, but maybe some needles were included. In any case, these grains (pictured) reliably produced failures 30cm down on all aspects in handpits. I don't know what changed within the new snow to create this instability, as the snowpack is otherwise rightside up. It should be noted, however, that, for the moment, these avalanches can be triggered remotely; are not limited to breaking at our feet. My hackles are up. \n",

Heavy snow around New Year's produced many large avalanches on the same PWL. Since then the snowpack has gained considerable strength and in most areas the snowpack is very deep - up to 200 cms or more. This avalanche failed in a shallower snowpack area, on a slope with a steep convexity that is subject to heavy wind loading. A stability test performed on a nearby slope produced no results. It is our opinion that this avalanche is somewhat anomalous with a perfect storm of conditions, and that avalanches like this are unlikely to be triggered by humans. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto illustrates location of weak layer on nearby slope.

As I got to roughly 9700 ft, the snow on the Lee side of the ridge got noticeably stiffer, with rounding on many features. The angle kicks up at the very top and realizing this I made a kick turn to bail to the windward side - as I was approaching the crest, I was conscience of the fact that my weight would likely set off a wind slab and on literally my last step to the ridge it did just that - the snow dropped Out from under my feet and I awkwardly rode the slab (heel lifters up) roughly 20 ft down to where the angle mellows out and came to a halt standing up. Looking back up, it looked like the crown was about a foot at its deepest and 25-30' wide. In hindsight, ski crampons and sticking to the windward side would have been the safer option and had the terrain below/ adjacent been steeper and more connected, I wouldn't have chosen this route up at all. That said, I did and even though I went with my gut to bail to the ridge, it still happened and in bigger more exposed terrain it could have been a much bigger consequence.

Skier three triggered the avalanche and was able to self arrest/ski off the slab. We re-grouped on the lower shoulder and although we were mostly confident nobody was in the basin where the avalanche ran into, out of an abundance of caution we sent one skier down to perform a transceiver search.\n\n \n\nWith two of us remaining on the shoulder to watch for any remaining hangfire from above, skier 2 skied onto the bed surface just uphill of the skiers right flank and performed a tranceiver signal search of the debris with no results or signal found. No tracks were noted in the area and we were now confident that nobody was buried in the avalanche. At this point we called Alta Ski Patrol to notify them of the avalanche and inform them that we had performed a transceiver search with no results. The two skiers on the shoulder then followed skier 2's tracks onto the bed surface to perform a crown profile while skier 2 transitioned and skinned back up the bed surface to the rest of the party.\n\n \n\nWe then skied back into the ski area via lower Patsy Marley, coming across another smaller avalanche which ASP was already aware of, and we performed a signal search with patrol there as well.  Overall, a more sensitive snowpack than we anticipated out there today, this one caught us off guard and we're lucky we didn't have a more serious involvement.

By inspecting the video, it looks like it was a big wind drift on the down-wind side of the ridge that broke loose.\n",

We were threading obvious wind drifts while breaking trail up a steep shoulder. At one point near the ridge into E facing Mill A, we backed off from walking across on particularly rounded pillow of snow, and then triggered the slide remotely from about 20' away while walking away from the open slope across a thin spot. The slide ran at least 1000' vertical, produced a dust cloud, and appeared to shake some big trees. \n\n \n\nAdding this text-only observation a day late because in hindsight it seems like the avalanche could have failed in a radiation-recrystalization or other NSF/crust combo that developed on 1/26. Initially we assumed it failed in pooled graupel, but the steep, planar slope seems more likely to bear some RR etc. than pooled graupel. No pics and no actual forensics because the light was bad and we were above the crown; so it's really just a hunch. But it seems like in some places there's complexity in the upper snowpack right now that folks (like me) don't always factor in, or dig down to evaluate, when they're mostly thinking about windslabs. Will it settle out with the frigid temps or in a few days? \n",

While skinning up towards Pole-line/Cardiff pass, we noticed a small avalanche on the southwest side of the Flagstaff shoulder with one ski track entering the crown, and we were unable to see any ski tracks exiting the debris or slope. We shifted directions towards the avalanche, and once at the bottom still could not see any tracks exiting. Despite the small size of the avalanche, we were concerned about a potential hangup in the trees within the path for the involved party. We decided to send two from our group of 5 up to perform a transceiver signal search because it appeared that the individual may have been traveling alone. The remaining group members stayed in the flats, keeping eyes on the hanging snow above, and called Alta Central to inform them of the situation, so Alta Ski Patrol could standby if the signal search yielded results. We turned our beacons to search at the toe of the debris, and continued to switchback up the slope, spacing out ~50 feet. The debris in the open snow, for the most part, was not deep enough to bury a human. On the trees there was debris piled up to 7 feet deep.\n\n \n\nAfter we reached the stauchwall(roughly) we were finally able to see a ski track exiting to the skier's right, through the trees, traversing far out on the slope away from the avalanche. Given the traversing nature of the track, it was almost impossible to see from a downhill angle. At this point, we put our transceivers back into send, and communicated the info back down to the rest of our party below so they could communicate back to Alta Central. Out of an abundance of caution, we sent one skier up to the uppermost trees, the last point where anyone involved in the avalanche could have been pinned. It seemed that the involved party had indeed arrested, pinned, or otherwise stopped against these trees, and then skied out. Hard to tell exactly, but this is my best guess. From here I traversed over to the crown to perform a quick profile, then skied back down to the rest of the group. Picture of the trees from uphill included below. Thankful there wasn't any serious involvement in this avalanche!\n\n \n\nPhotos below:\n\n \n",

This slide failed as a slab of wind drifted snow on a layer of small grain facets above a solar crust. The slab was between 10-20\" deep. While it is hard to tell if it failed on small grain facets that were formed by radiation recrystallization, the setup seems. Small grain facets exist below the crust as well. Radiation recrystallization was occurring on the surface above the crown. \n\nNotes from Tim: \nThis morning before work I got in a quick Beartrap Aspens lap. From the ridge summit of Aspens, around 8800 feet, I noticed a large southeast-facing slide off of the West Willow Ridgeline into Mule Hollow. I've skied that aspect and area several times this year, but in less sensitive snowpack conditions, and was personally surprised to see a slide there, especially since the WBSkiing app has this area labeled white, aka not steep enough to slide. It's a good lesson to use the app only as general guideline when observing slope aspects and steepness. \n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say the slide is a few hundred feet long and wide, and several feet deep. Based on where I was standing on the lower ridge summit below, I'd guess the cause was natural due to heavy wind loading from the most recent storm, and that this slide probably happened over the weekend. I did not notice any tracks going in, or near, the slide path, so I did not feel it was necessary to ski into Mule Hollow and do a proper beacon search. If I had seen tracks going into the slide, I probably would have done so. \n \n\nLooking forward to the snowpack healing up again to sneak in some bigger lines. Stay safe people.  \n",

We rode east, south, and west facing slopes and actually found the best riding on south facing slopes.  \n\n \n\nOn the way out we started seeing wet sluffs on south facing slopes with some roller balls (see pic 3)\n\n \n\nWe also noticed two very large avalanches up Wood Camp on Ham Hill (south facing slopes at 7000 and 8400 feet.  We could not get pictures of these slides but they would be very interesting to get a closer look at.\n",

          "Comments 1": "Started the tour today under cloudy skies that soon turned to heavy snowfall of approximately 1 inch per hour. Had a route planned to climb and to ski what we believed to be safe and protected from the recent winds. We had discussed the possible danger, and wind slabs were the top of the list to look out for. The planned climbing route is one I had used a few times in years past, but had most often used as a descent route. As I was climbing I noticed the wind cross loading slopes well above us, and we discussed the route that we planned to ski as it may have been in that zone. But we did not discuss the climbing route as we were not seeing much wind transport in that area. \n\n \n\nThe initial ascent route was in a tight creek bottom. Anything with some south aspect had rollerballed and had a stout crust from the day before. Just a few feet away north facing felt soft, with a slight density inversion 6-8\" down. The skin track varied from crust stout enough to not break through, up to 8 inches of ski penetration. The light was very flat, and it was difficult to tell uphill from down in many places and slope steepness was hard to judge. This led to the mistake of being on this slope. \n\n \n\nFrom looking at the map earlier in the tour, I had planned to be up out of the creek bottom and onto a north facing bench sooner, But with very few visual clues and the intense snowfall rate, I had missed this turn. As we were skinning up the drainage, I noticed the slope get steeper but struggled to plan the track due to the flat light. I could see some brush ahead and misestimated the slope angle between myself and the brush. As I climbed towards it, it became too steep to skin that direction so I stopped to kick turn to my right. As I completed my kick turn I heard a loud crack and the slope started to move. \n\n \n\nAs I had already changed direction my ski started to turn downhill and I was able to stay *mostly* on top of the debris. My partner, who was still facing uphill as the slide started, was sucked backwards, skis pulling under. I yelled for him to swim right as I was getting ready to go over the top of him. Luckily, the slope angle had gently backed off and the slide started to slow. When the snow stopped moving, I was able to take off skis and stand up. My partner was partially buried, waist deep with his head facing uphill, but downhill from his skis. His skis were under enough snow that I had to dig them out to release his bindings. \n\n \n\nThe maximum crown depth was three feet, and averaged around 18 inches. Crown was 45-50 feet wide and total slide distance from crown to toe was about 60 feet. The wind slab was very cohesive and stayed in large blocks through the avalanche. It entrained a shocking amount of snow for the size. The crown was on a slope angle of 35 degrees, and broke about 5 feet above us, right at a convex roll. The angle of the slope at the toe was 20 degrees. \n\n \n\nWe were very lucky that this happened on a slope with overall convexity with the slope angle backing off gently. Many places in the creek bottom we we're traveling through had sharp concave sections that could easily have been terrain traps. I am disappointed that I underestimated the amount of snow that had been loading in this zone over the previous days. Being fairly low elevation and in a tight drainage I mistakenly thought that the area hadn't seen much wind. I am also disappointed that I failed to recognize the windslab, and mistook it for a supportable crust. I don't think I had on my \"avalanche eyes\" at this point due to complacency and ease of travel. Had I been paying better attention to the route, and doing small checks of the snow along the way, I may have seen earlier signs of slab. One pole was lost, overall a very cheap lesson. \n\n \n\n \n",

I've never seen a slide path in the canyon before in the 5 years I've lived in it. Snow depth is around 2-3 feet on those slopes and it looks to have broke near the ground, probably 18\" crown or so with a 100+ foot width. The slope angle is 40+ degrees on these slopes, so a very steep angle. \n\n \n\nThis is notable because during the winters this area is an active one for bow hunters, I've regularly seen them on these aspects hiking in the snow. The runout was around 500 feet through a few terrain traps. There's still a lot of snow on the northerly aspects below 6k feet, hikers and hunters need to be aware. Unclear what triggered this slide, possibly a large animal, we have a few herd of deer around. \n\n \n\n \n\nForecaster Notes:  Thank you for the report- we have seen a few other animal triggered (?) slides in the foothills this winter (Big Cottonwood, Ogden). We went to look at this avalanche on February 20th. It stood out as unique and we wanted to see what the lower elevation snowpack looked like prior to the next storm.  This avalanche was most likely triggered by a deer on a layer of rounding facets above a melt freeze crust. It averaged 12\" deep, 18\" at the deepest on a 35 degree slope. The avalanche was 30' wide and between the 2 slides ran about 300' down the slope. It was difficult to see the debris as it dispersed into the trees.  I believe this was from an easterly canyon wind that cross loaded the slope. We did not go to the crown face as there were  cracks above the crown and not worth the risk.\n\n \n\nPhoto 1- Upper avalanche\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nPhoto 2- Lower avalanche\n\n\n\n \n\nPhoto 3- Snowpit\n\n\n",

First boarder hugged the trees on the skiers left of the main run and had a clean run to the basin. Second boarder cut a bit skiers right into a wind loaded run and immediately set off the slab. They took a few more turns and cut left, avoiding the bulk of the slide. They made it safely to the bottom without getting caught. The slide ran for about 200 feet. \n\n \n\nFrom the party that triggered the avalanche (KL)\n\n \n\nAfter watching a group safely descend Upper Days, my buddy dropped in to Two Dogs & rode out safely. I dropped in next, further skiers right into slightly steeper terrain. On my 2nd turn I triggered the edge of a large wind slab . Fortunately I was able to ride out & veer skiers left out of the slide path. It picked up some speed part way down the slope & ran a few hundred feet, definitely large enough to catch & carry. The avy report was dead on this morning & in hindsight given the wind slab risk & strong winds on the ridge, we should have stuck to lower slope angles.\n\n \n",

None of us had done this approach before. We could see skyline through the trees and decided that two of our party would wait a safe distance back in the trees while two of us checked out the entrance onto the ridge. The two that continued realized that we were high as soon as we popped out of the trees and briefly talked about options, including going back down into the trees and retreating lower. However, the top of the ridge was one good kick turn away and we got sucked into that \"it’s so close” trap.\n\nAs my partner took some steps toward the top of the ridge I actually backed away even further and started getting pretty nervous but only said, “be careful, that looks wind loaded.” My partner was focused on a cornice on his left until he said, “oh, this is where the wind is dropping all the snow”. I had turned around and yelled to our other members to “not come up here”. I had decided we really should retreat, but I was too late and my partner yelled “slide”, and I turned back and saw the wind slab below the ridge break all around him. I tried to ski out to the side as I was on the very edge of where it propagated, but it hit me almost immediately. It broke probably 25’ wide and ran 50-60’; enough to take both of us for a short ride. My partner stopped at a tree probably 20’ down and I stopped at a tree 30’ down.\n\nNo burial, and no injuries besides a bruise. We did lose some poles. Once we determined everyone was ok we retreated and had a good debriefing and discussion of the traps we fell into.\n\nThings we did right were space our party out as we became unsure of the route and terrain.\n\nThings we did wrong were not turn around when we realized we had not approached the ridge the way we had intended. We knew we were in the wrong place, but got sucked into the feeling that it was just “right there”. The cornice drew our awareness away from the lower soft wind slab deposited below the ridge. Also, things can happen so quickly. Decisions can be made without fully understanding you are making them. Our group had a good dynamic and good communication generally, but in this moment we just didn’t take enough time. By the time I had processed my discomfort with the danger of continuing onto the ridge, it was too late. I needed to speak up immediately and more clearly. We should have returned and told the other two of our party the situation. I’m certain that would have changed our forward momentum and given us the time to make a better decision. We had been in pretty benign terrain all day, and had intended to keep it that way, but it only took 30 seconds for that to get away from us.\n\n",

I skied first, and at about 8000' noticed a very long crack propagating to the south. About 10 seconds later I saw a large powder cloud racing down the south side of the bowl, very far to the skier's right of my line. On our way back down to Franklin Basin, we had improved visibility and were able to check out the crown, which averaged a bit over 2 feet deep.

The snow appeared to be wind-drifted and based on observations I was expecting some sort of result out of the slope. As I was about 5 feet above the apex of the convexity the avalanche released, propogated around 50 feet wide and ran for 20-30 vertical feet. Non-consequential avalanche in relatively non-consequential terrain, however there was still a significant amount of snow(~4feet) stacked up on the tree immediately below the crown. The slab varied in hardness but was generally 1F. This avalanche along with numerous other smaller ones that we triggered today were isolated to ridgelines and other areas more exposed to the wind. Below the ridgelines, we found awesome powder skiing in undisturbed light density snow. Throughout the tour, we found said light density snow on the surface to be incredibly slippery, some of the crystals rimed, some not. I will be more suscpicious of sensitive storm/wind slabs as the next load comes tonight given this info. We toured from white pine, into redpine, and exiting maybird, traveling on almost every aspect other than south. Observed cracking, and some smaller avalanches all over anywhere that was exposed to the wind.\n",

I figured the terrain wasn't too consequential, it has no terrain traps.\n\n \n\nI intentionally ski cut the middle Race Start, skiing left towards the spur between middle and upper. The whole middle bowl ripped from the top and luckily I planned my ski cut well enough. The slope shattered around me but I was easily able to ski 15 feet left to safety on the spur.\n\n \n\nThe wind slab broke about 2' deep, 100' wide and ran 450'.

          "Comments 1": "Our party broke trail up Pink Pine Ridge to Rainbow Peak. Snow felt very stable until we reached the ridge where some windblown snow was coated with a layer of graupel. From the ridge we set the remaining boot pack to the top of rainbow peak. Along the way, the top 4 inches of new snow showed signs of instability (cracking, blocking) on the windward side of the ridge. Knowing there would be a good chance of a wind slab over graupel on Rainbow Peak chute I cut the top of the slope. This cut released an avalanche that slide the entire length of the chute. After cutting the slope I entered a island of safety to the right of the slope as the avalanche passed by. Only once the slide settled did I continue cautiously to the bottom.\n \n\nI think this episode shows the importance of identifying zones of safety before riding through avalanche terrain and cutting the top of a slope before entering the terrain below. While zones of safety and slope cuts are NOT a solution in avalanche terrain they do play a small part in mitigating risks. Please ride safely out there. \n",

This type of avalanche was ubiquitous around the range on many aspects above 8500'. There was evidence of another similar slide up higher in the drainage just below the headwall on the east facing slopes of the East Twin in Mary Ellen Gulch. This slide was remote triggered over 300m away due to mitigation work in the neighboring drainage of Mineral Basin (48 hours prior). There was also buried debris all throughout the drainage. The natural cycle, and ensuing AE and AS triggered avalanches during and following the week's storm is impressive. A truly widespread problem in the technical sense of the word.\n\nPhotos:\n\n1.

The slide released a deeper pocket possibly 18\" deep skier's left likely on pooled grapuel below steep rocky feature, which ran roughly 200' on the left side of skier's tracks before piling up on gully terrain feature. Ski tracks weren't overrun as they were on lower angle terrain/subtle ridge around which the slides split. I didn't realize slides had released until I was stopped in a safe zone and saw powder cloud and debris coming to a stop. Didn't see many other signs of instability though there were occasionally high precip rates and enough wind for significant transport. Fortunate to have found the instability on a less exposed slope.

We sent one skier down without incident. I was second and took a line a few yards away from the first skiers line. I saw a lower slope angle and thought I was taking a safer route. After my second turn I saw a shooting crack at my ski tip, fell, and was carried about 10 yards down slope. The lower angle slope was actually a wind loaded pillow.

All of us at the Utah Avalanche Center has had our own close calls and know how easy it is to make mistakes. Here are some take-a-ways from this accident:\n\n\n\tBoth brothers carried an avalanche transceiver, shovel, and probe, along with airbag backpacks and radios for communication.\n\tSnowmobiles are very useful tools during an avalanche rescue because they allow someone to cover long distances quickly; however, they also cause electro-magnetic interference with transceivers. Identifying and mitigating this interference is crucial. The current recommendation is to be 3 meters away from a snowmobile when searching. They can be used in the signal search phase of a rescue, but you need to stop occasionally move 3 meters away from the snowmobile. If there is no signal, return to the sled and change locations.\n\tAvalanche airbags can limit burial depth but are much less effective in terrain traps. Additionally, terrain traps tend to cause deep burials because the avalanche debris often accumulates deeper than it would otherwise. Deep burials are very hard to survive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAvalanche probes are delicate pieces of equipment and most are generally less than 3 meters long. One piece of equipment the group found very valuable was a Pieps iProbe, an electronic probe that can detect a transceiver signal. Without having a probe strike for some time, this tool helped direct their digging efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAlways only to expose one person to avalanche terrain at one time. It was very lucky in this case that both riders were not buried.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n",

It appears to be skier triggered as there were some tracks adjacent to the slope that slid, as well as what appears to be a track going into the slope at the top.\n\n \n\nSimilar slopes nearby had some wind-loading and am guessing this slope was also wind-loaded. It also faces east which is a leeward aspect from the recent northwest winds.\n\n \n\nThe weak layer is a layer of lower-density snow just above the dust crust. I found this weak layer on Thursday in the Catherine's Pass Area, and it is apparently still reactive as other avalanches reported from Saturday are also failing on this weak layer. \n\n \n\nWe found no other signs of instability such as cracking and it seems you need a denser slab with some wind-loading to make this weak layer reactive.\n",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "3 Skiers approached Mt Aire from Lambs Canyon, Wednesday morning January 25. They ascended a North-South running ridge on Mt Aire and experienced at least one collapse in low angle terrain during the approach. They skied an East aspect off the ridge and did not report any collapsing or cracking. They switched to the West side of the ridge on a slope with a NW aspect. Skier 1 descended and continued to the trailhead. Skier 2 triggered the slide, but skier 1 did not know this. Skier 2 was caught and carried approximately 75 feet downhill to some trees but was not buried and not injured. Skier 3 descended to perform a rescue.\n\nSkier 2 was ok. Because they did not see skier 1, they assumed he was buried. They performed a beacon search but did not receive a signal. They reported that Skier 1 had been having some sort of trouble with his beacon this year; therefore, they assumed he was buried but his beacon was not working. At that point, they called 911 to get help. With no beacon signal, Skier's 2 & 3 and began probing areas with a high probability of burial (like the uphill side of trees). They scoured every inch of debris continuing to probe all likely areas. As they worked closer to the toe of the debris, they spotted skier 1's ski tracks which were not obvious. They followed his tracks to the trail head and discovered he was ok. While skiing back to the trail head, another avalanche was triggered on buried surface hoar.\n\nWe at the UAC are all very happy no one was injured or killed. We are also very appreciative that members of the party were very open and willing to talk about this incident so that the rest of us can learn and be safer. Avalanches are stressful and confusing events. What is important in this scenario is that they exposed only one person at a time to the avalanche terrain. Despite the confusion, only one person was caught. Skier 2 was lucky to have avoided trauma. Even small avalanches moving slowly can cause serious trauma. Running into a tree a 20 mph (which is slow for an avalanche) can hurt.",

Surface hoar just like frost on a car windshield except it is very fragile and can easily be destroyed by wind or sunshine. Winds began to increase on Wednesday night (1/18) and into Thursday morning (1/19), before diminishing midday on Thursday. At the Reynolds Peak wind station at 9400 ft, winds blew generally from the S and SSW 10-15 mph with only slightly stronger gusts. A the Parleys Summit weather station at 7000 ft, the strongest winds blew 10 mph gusting to 15 mph from a generally westerly direction. In contrast, winds at 11,000 ft in Little Cottonwood Canyon briefly blew 30 mph gusting to 50 mph from the S.\n\nA weak storm system deposited 3-5\" in the Salt Lake mountains on Thursday. This snow capped and preserved this surface hoar layer on sheltered slopes where it wasn't destroyed by the wind. Snowfall since Thursday contained 1.8 inches of water at the Parleys Summit SNOTEL site at 7500 ft just north of Summit Park and I-80. Snowfall since Thursday contained 2.08 inches of water at the Spruces weather station at 7400 ft in Big Cottonwood Canyon. On the day of the accident, we found 18-26 inches of snow on top of the surface hoar layer which corresponds well to these water numbers.",

At the choke, the first successfully rappelled down and waited for the second to join him below. At that point, a wet loose slide cascaded down upon them from above, pummeling the second who was on rappel while catching and carrying the first over two minor cliffbands. It is not known whether the person on rappel was clipped into the anchor or backed up with an autoblock above or below his rappel device. It is also not known whether the loose sluff was a natural or triggered from above. \n\nAfter the avalanche, both were able to make it down to the road unassisted. \n\nPhotos courtesy Stacee at Powderbird",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "I was skiing alone, coming back into Little Cottonwood Canyon from Cardiac Bowl after a long and very enjoyable morning of skiing mostly north and some east facing classic Wasatch powder. I gained the ridgeline at the Little Superior Buttress, and decided to make my descent from just above it. As I removed my skins up on the ridge, I examined the slope below. The initial portion of the run dropped about 100 feet south east facing before opening up into a broader bowl above a rock band. My intention was to make my way skiers left over to the frequently skied fin that drops from just below the buttress.\n As I gained the more south facing open bowl above the rock band, I noticed a large number of roller balls and debris coming down from above. The next thing I knew, I was in the middle of a large wet slab avalanche. I suppose the release knocked me down, but at first it seemed like the slab was moving slowly. it started gaining speed as it carried me towards a funnel through the rock band. Unfortunately I was on my back with my legs and skis above me. I was unable to move to right myself and I realized I was going over the rock band, headfirst. The snow was so dense that I easily floated on top. It was like riding a 2 foot thick churning carpet of roller balls and slush. I believe it protected me from the rocks as I went backwards over the probably 20' rock band.\nIt certainly cushioned the blow as I came down on the slope below. Once over the rock band, the slide continued to gain speed. I had only one ski and one pole still with me, but I managed to get an edge into the sliding snow. I fought hard with the remaining pole and my free arm to get off of the slide to skier's left, just before it poured over the choke of a second and slightly taller rock band. For what seemed like a really long time, more than a minute for sure, the wet slide just kept pouring down from above and through the choke.\nWith the slide over, I waited for the adrenaline rush to subside somewhat and determined that I didn't have any serious injuries. I dialed 911 to alert Alta Central about the slide and that nobody had been buried in it. As I down climbed the rock band, kicking toeholds into the remaining snow, I punched through a few places to reveal a virtual waterfall- 3-4\" of running water below the snow surface.\nAnother 200 feet or so below, the slide had come to a stop in a broad tongue of debris 2-3 feet deep. My lost pole and ski were easily retrieved from their final resting places atop the debris pile. Making my way down to them, the bed surface was a moistened, but still bulletproof sun crust- completely scoured of the weekend's new snow. It wasn't until the low angle apron just above the road that I ever noted the snow surface to be getting damp and manky.\n\nForecaster Note: It's unknown if this was a wet loose sluff, or perhaps a slab. So we've classified it as a Storm Snow slide.",

We skied one run and on the second run the first skier dropped in and made 4 turns and just beyond the crest a 2- 2 1/2 foot fracture 80-100 feet wide broke loose. He rode it down almost buried (only head visable) and it came to a stop 100-120 yards down. He was buried up to waist and was able to dig out on own. \nOvercast, foggy, no wind around 30 degrees.\n\nSnow was medium weight powder on top 2 feet and the slope angle was around 35-40 degree where the fracture occured. The debre at the bottom of slide was 3-4 feet deep. \nThe slide let loose slowly--did no hear anything.\nNone\nNo new snow and it did not appear to be much wind loading.\nI would pass by this line in the future.\n\nYour Avalanche forcast for the day describes very much what happend in this incident. I can send photos later if you would like. Also the slide is visible from the top of the Milli lift.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "With permission and from Mark White's Blog : \"Today we headed up Butler Fork thinking that we would stay out of the wind and ski a sheltered NE facing bowl at around 9,000ft. We realized the snow was denser than expected and slightly inverted on our hike in but we stayed out of the wind and never felt any slabby snow. This bowl is steep at the top, 38 plus degrees, then mellows out rapidly in the middle. We ascended in the steep trees on skiers right side, did a ski cut that only produced sluffing and skied the bowl with no obvious instabilities. We proceeded to hike up again but this time went up about 10 feet higher, still on the edge of the trees. My partner was about 10 feet in front of me and stomped out a flat spot to take his skins off, next thing we know the bowl is fracturing 50ft above us. My partner was on the edge of the slide and just got pushed 2 feet. I was in the middle, got pushed into a stand of trees and got buried to the top of my chest. I also heard and felt my hamstring pop. I was still in hiking mode with toes locked in and skins on with my legs all twisted up. It required my partner to dig me out and release my skis from my feet. A few minutes after I was out we heard a pop and the middle of the bowl pulled out remotely. The first slide was 100ft wide, 18 inches at the deepest point. The next slide extended the crown to 250ft and ran to where the slope flattened out. I doubt we would’ve triggered a slide if we would have stayed lower out of the windslab. The windslab wasn’t obvious but it only makes sense in retrospect. There’s a massive cornice at the top and while the wind wasn’t out of hand it was still loading the slope right below the cornice with denser snow. Sometimes the line between triggering a slide and not is thin but it sucks to be on the wrong side of that line. Just glad I had a good partner with me and can ski on one leg fairly efficiently. Mistakes were definitely made but we live and hopefully learn from them.\"\n\n \n\n ",

About 2.7 miles from the parking lot they started to divert off the main trail and ascend toward a ridge. They were making switchbacks up a slope when they triggered an avalanche. The avalanche propagated about 300 feet above them. One skier was able to grab a tree and avoid taking the ride which the other skier did. He took about a 300 foot ride and was strained through some aspens and completely buried near the toe. His partner who did not go for a ride located him with an avalanche transceiver and dug him out from under about 4 feet of snow. He was uninjured and they were able to return to the parking lot on their own.",

Neither ski areas are open yet and have yet to conduct any avalanche control within their boundaries. We interviewed the victim's ski partner. To say he was shaken up is an understatement. \n\nWhile neither had any rescue gear or formal avalanche training, they were both expert skiers and knew the terrain well. They had not consulted the avalanche advisory that morning in which the danger was rated Considerable to High. They continued to Snowbird via Baldy and accessed the Peruvian Cirque to gain the Gad Valley. While ascending out of the Peruvian Cirque they remotely triggered a large avalanche that covered their tracks that they had just made. It's unclear whether they realized they had triggered this large avalanche. They gained the ridge and prepared to drop into Gad Valley.\n\nWith the partner watching, the victim dropped into the slope, immediately triggering the slide. He was carried approximately 800 feet through steep rocky terrain and reportedly went over a small cliff band and came to a stop only partially buried. The partner went down to help the victim and called for a rescue, alerting both the Snowbird Ski Patrol and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, who subsequently accessed and evacuated the victim. ",

You always hear people say, that will never happen to me. Unfortunately, you never know. It’s a risk we take every day in the backcountry.\n\n \n\nWe were extremely lucky today. We happened to be in the wrong place. A slide was triggered and one of our friends was caught and carried. He fought to stay on top of the snow headed downhill head first. His sled was stopped by a big pine tree and buried pretty deep. He got separated from his sled and continued down to the next tree. This is where Curtis found him within a minute or so. His hand was out of the snow. Curtis started digging to clear his airways. Justin was talking, while Curtis worked to get him the rest of the way out. His adrenaline kicked in and was going as soon as Curtis got him out.\n\n\nDid we make mistakes today? Maybe. But we also did everything we have been trained to do. We checked the UAC forecast, we had our gear and used our training to make it home safe.\n\n ",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "During very warm, springtime conditions, a local doctor and his friend from Alaska (also a doctor) left at 4:00 am on April 28th to climb Stairs Gulch with crampons, ice axes and a rope, but no beacons. Stairs Gulch is a very steep and very large avalanche path (5,000 vertical feet) near the bottom of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Few people venture into Stairs Gulch during the winter but sometimes climbers like to test their snow skills there in spring. As the pair ascended in the early morning darkness a large glide avalanche released high above them and descended into the narrow gully they were ascending. When they failed to show up by their scheduled noon return time, searchers found the boot of one victim sticking out of the snow and a search dog located the second victim about four hundred yards above the first victim and he was buried about 8 feet deep.\n\nThis is the first known fatality from a glide avalanche in Utah and perhaps the only one in the U.S. Glide avalanches occur when wet snow slides slowly on the ground, similar to a glacier, often for several days, until they randomly release.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "When a party of four riders entered the bowl from the top it was completely untracked and nice smooth powder. The east facing slope south of Saint Charles Peak is committing because there is no good way to ride out the bottom, so you have to come back up the hill in order to exit the drainage. The party played around on adjacent slopes and two had successfully climbed back out of the 36 degree slope a few times. \n\nThe slope had several tracks in it at the time of the avalanche. One rider climbed to the saddle on the top and watched, and a second was at the bottom also watching as the third attempted the climb. On the second attempt, the 47-year-old rider's sled did not have quite enough power to make the climb, and he turned near the top of the slope. The snow on the slope fractured even as the rider guided his sled in a rightward arc back down the hill. \n\nThe avalanche caught rider and sled near the south flank and a large rock held up the sled for a bit while the rider was carried (he mentioned using swimming motions) to near the toe at the bottom of the avalanche, ending up about 150' below his sled, face-down and partially buried in the debris. The fourth rider was below on the slope and heading up when the slope fractured. He decided to keep his sled pointed up the hill and rode on top of the slab, the throttle pegged, track spinning like a treadmill as the slab ran underneath, leaving him safely on the bed surface. \n\nThe other riders were able to get down to the lucky survivor and had him out of a face-down partial burial quite quickly. He was quickly spotted by his companions, and they had him out of the debris in \"really only a couple minutes.\" Thankfully, now He is mainly only shaken, and recovering from minor injuries. The sled was damaged in the avalanche, but the party repaired it in the field the next day and rode it out of the hole. \n\n ",

The rescue ended up going on well into the night, and involved about 50 rescuers from Cache, Franklin, and Bear Lake Counties. Read Report\n\nThe same slope was the site of a tragic fatality on February 19, 2000. Read Report \n\nThe avalanche occurred on a mostly east facing slope and started at around 9200' in elevation. The toe of the avalanche was at around 8700'. The slope measures only about 36 degrees in steepness in the steepest area, and I measured the Alpha angle of this avalanche at 25 degrees.",

He was able to escape it but his friend was caught. The large avalanche carried the victim and his sled a short distance. The sled ended up completely buried and the victim was buried to his waist, uninjured. Rescue involved digging out the victim and the sled which was not damaged.

The slide was triggered at the steep break over at the top of the rib, and the portion that the skier was caught in was about 60' wide and 2 feet deep. However, the slide was able to propagate to skiers left, into part of an adjacent gully, where it was closer to 90 feet wide, and entrained much more snow.

According to a second-hand account, the skier tried to grab a tree (see the photo of the glove attached to the tree) and was able to do so for a few seconds before being carried. This may have helped save them from being carried more deeply into the debris. The crown of the avalanche was 12-24\" deep and the avalanche propagated widely - over 600' and across two other drainages. This was a very large and dangerous avalanche with a fortunate outcome.\n\n ",

One skier caught, carried and appeared to dislocate both shoulders.\nUDOT will look at the slide and we will post what they find.\nHere is a post on the TGR forum by the victim, which I reprint with permission after talking to him on the phone today.\nskibum is most likely referring to me... skied supe with telethor, tt's cousin and whapworth this morning, what an amazing run that is. great snow, noticed some debris in the usual spots but nothing too scary. left those guys at the bottom to go ski the bird with a buddy, and had a great day there too. about 2-3pm, i decided to ski out to white pine with a couple guys, one happened to be a coach for the SB freeski team and longtime ripper so i was confident following his lead, especially after our amazing run down sketchier SE superior. we skied to the very top of scotty's, scoped a little, and he dropped first, noticing sloughing but nothing much. since it was N facing and i was thinking it had been pretty cold with inconsistent sun all day, wet slabs were the last thing in my mind, and breaking off a deep slab was also not really something i was worried about. i dropped second in our party of three. made 2-3 turns on the spine i dropped on, and then got the feeling something wasn't right. figured some slough was chasing me, tried to stay high on the shoulder, but a BIG slab had ripped out above and around me. the rest is a blur, but i got taken in the 500-1000 foot range down the slope, maybe 2-300 vert. couldn't get my avalung in, as i think my shoulders had already popped from swimming when i went for it, my head went under a few times, and i came very close to numerous large trees. ended up in the open area underneath, with a bit of snow over my legs (whice were above my head), but head and most of body up. both skis/poles were apparently gone (partner found 2 skis 1 pole), and my shoulders were both completely dislocated, but i was up and OK. later on in the clinic (I somehow managed to avoid a chopper ride and skied the final ~1500 vert out, hunched over and in some serious pain) i heard it was 3-4 feet at the crown, and 200 feet wide. no idea how deep the debris was, though it didn't seem very deep where i ended up, but with the amount of snow that came down i am sure it could have buried me (my partner was luckily around 100 feet away from my resting place). it was by far the scariest moment of my entire life, and by sheer luck, and maybe a bit of help from the swimming, i made it, but it could have very easily turned out differently had i smashed one of the large trees or ended up in a different spot in the debris. i don't know if it was stupidity in not recognizing the significant warming from morning to afternoon, or an anomaly that i happened to strike in just the right place, but regardless i am thankful to be alive and happy no one else was involved. i plan on calling the UAC tomorrow and giving them my full account of what happened (i got home from the OR, where they had to completely get me under to get my L shoulder back in, around midnight tonight), and am very interested to read the full report. i learned a sobering lesson the hard way, but am lucky to live to ski another day, though i have a feeling it is going to take awhile for me to feel comfortable beyond the boundaries again. be careful out there guys, i am surprised and grateful that after my ride on a day when people were getting after much bigger stuff then scotty's, no one else was apparently injured or worse.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "Two skiers, a 50 year old male (Tyson Bradley) working as lead guide and a 49 year old client (Douglas Green), were backcountry skiing in the Mill A drainage of Big Cottonwood Canyon. They were part of a group of 8 containing 3 guides and 5 clients who ascended Gobbler's ridge via Baker pass. They observed a size 2.5 (destructive scale) natural avalanche from the previous day on an east facing slope on Mt. Raymond but no cracking, collapsing or other signs of instability on the day of the accident.\n\nBradley and one client descended a south facing avalanche path west of and adjacent to the path of the fatal avalanche. After this run the client left the area because he had a meeting in town at 12:30 p.m. They skied the slope without incident while the rest of the group skied a north westerly facing, treed slope known as the “Benign Line.”\n\nAfter the first run Bradley re-ascended the ridge and approached the top of the run called Whitesnake. He was joined by three others, one of whom was Douglas Green, and an apprentice guide. The third guide and one other client skied the “Benign Line” again.\n\nBradley dropped into the Whitesnake path, made a few ski cuts, and stopped 300' downhill at an island of safety on skier’s right about a foot above and to the side of where the avalanche released (see photo). He directed Green to ski to him. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run. After regrouping, Bradley began skiing again and directed Green to remain where they had stopped. While skiing the next section, the guide felt the slope collapse (which is the weak layer failing just before the avalanche releases). At the same time he noticed Green had started skiing as well. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run.\n\nBradley was caught in the avalanche but continued moving right. He impacted a tree and was pushed upward by the avalanche but not carried downhill. He was partially buried and sustained minor injuries. Green was carried downhill and fully buried. He inflated his avalanche air-bag backpack at some point during the avalanche.\n\nAfter extricating himself from avalanche debris, Bradley skied down the scoured avalanche path and around an exposed rock band where he triggered a small avalanche. He started a beacon search at the edge of the avalanche debris. After covering several hundred yards of debris, he acquired the Green’s signal. His beacon indicated a distance of 77 meters. At the burial location the smallest distance displayed by his beacon was 0.9 meters. He pinpointed Green’s exact location with an avalanche probe.\n\nGreen was fully buried on his side with his head approximately 3 feet deep and his body approximately 4-5 feet. His avalanche airbag was inflated. Maximum debris depth was 15 feet. Bradley dug him out of the debris and began CPR. He could not find a pulse. The apprentice guide and two other skiers arrived about a minute after Bradley began digging. They assisted in the exhausting work of digging Green out of the debris. The avalanche was reported at 14:30 to Alta Central Dispatch by the third guide. A medical helicopter landed and evacuated both the Bradley and Green to a hospital in Salt Lake City where Green was pronounced deceased.\n\nThe enormous debris pile snapped aspen trees and covered the terrain trap gully below the avalanche path for hundreds of yards. There was no stauchwall or lower boundary of the avalanche because the slab covering the entire slope released, creating an enormous amount of avalanche debris. The avalanche - estimated at 1-2' deep and 600' wide, pulled down every bit of snow between the starting zone near the ridge at 10,000' and well into the gulley at 9000'. The alpha angle, the angle from the toe of the debris to the crown, was 22 degrees.\n\nThe Utah Avalanche Center rated the avalanche danger in this terrain as Considerable and had issued an Avalanche Warning on January 21, 2016. See danger rose and bottom line below from that day’s advisory.\n\n\n\n“There [are] many weak layers and issues that will cause avalanches today. All the red flags are present. Widespread recent avalanche activity both natural and human triggered, recent snow and strong winds, widespread faceted layers in the snowpack, and today will have strong sunshine and temperatures possibly going above freezing. All these factors combine to make very dangerous avalanche conditions and a HIGH avalanche danger.”\n\nThe full advisory from that day can be found at:\n\nhttps://utahavalanchecenter.org/advisory/salt-lake/01/21/2016\n\n ",

The starting zone aspects ran from 107 degrees ESE to 215 degrees SSW. The upper starting zone was cross-loaded from strong west to northwest winds in the late evening of January 19 into January 20. Slope angles across the crown were not measured as conditions remained too hazardous to access the fracture line, though the starting zone is estimated at 35-37 degrees. Two adjacent slopes avalanched naturally several days later on January 24 and January 27.",

        "Weather Conditions and History": "The weather has been complex this winter. November’s snow was followed by a long, dry spell with only small, intermittent snow storms through early December. Periodic cold temperatures and clear skies faceted the shallow snowpack on shady slopes during this time. A series of storms between December 12th and 25th added several feet of snow to the snow pack and led to a major avalanche cycle.\n\nWeather events became even more complex in January. The New Year was ushered in with a strong southeasterly wind event that scoured and loaded unusual aspects, producing another avalanche cycle. This was followed by small, almost daily storms between January 3rd and 8th. A dry spell between January 9th and 13th, with warm sunny days and clear cold nights, developed near surface facets on shady slopes and created ice crusts on top of faceted snow on solar aspects.\n\nBetween January 14th and 20th, snow fell six out of seven days, culminating on January 20th with strong southwest to northwesterly winds, dense heavy snow and an active avalanche cycle. Snow totals from Big Cottonwood and the Park City side ranged from 7” to 11\" on the 20th, with storm water equivalents of .65\" to 1.04\". The Mill D North SNOTEL site had similar SWE numbers.\n\nJanuary 21st had sunny skies and temperatures ranging from near 10 degrees F into the low 20s.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "Timothy Robert Baker, 24, died in an avalanche he triggered under the cliffs in Dutch Draw n February 23, 2012.\nThis is information is from talking with the Canyons ski patrollers who responded to the accident and a visit to the site by UAC forecasters Evelyn Lees and Brett Kobernik. More details may be added later if it is possible to interview the survivor.\n\nThe accident occurred in Dutch Draw, a backcountry area south of the Canyons Resort.\n\nTimothy and his partner were on snowboards. They left through the well marked boundary gate at the top of 9990 Lift and traversed south It is believed both the victim and his partner descended about 150 or 200’ below the ridgeline and stopped near the cliffs. Then Timothy descended the next section first, triggered a slab avalanche. He was caught, carried and buried. Neither he nor his partner were wearing a beacon or had rescue gear.\n\nRescue: Timothy’s partner immediately headed down to the debris and started searching. As other backcountry travelers in adjacent area came into view, he called out for help, and a total of 8 people arrived. One was sent for help. The other 7 people searched the debris. None of the parties were equipped with beacons or rescue gear. Some skiers popped the baskets off their poles and probed. One struck the victim’s snowboard and they started digging just as 2 Canyons ski patrollers arrived on the scene. Timothy was dug out, and a ski patroller and Timothy’s partner started CPR. They transported the victim to a nearby flat area where a medical helicopter could land and transport the victim to the hospital. The victim was buried about 40 minutes. It is unknown if he died from trauma or asphyxiation.\n\nThe victim was carried about 600 vertical feet, strained through small trees, and buried near the toe of the slide. He buried head first downhill, face down, with his head approximately 3 feet below the snow surface in debris that was about 6 to 8 feet deep. The snowboard was broken in half, but held together by some of the material. \n\n \n\nemail from Jay Torgersen, Flight Paramedic, AirMed\n\nI was on the AirMed team that responded to the Canyons and worked with their Patrol on the side-country accident/fatality yesterday. Our team was made up of Casey Thompson-RN, Troy Stanton-Pilot and myself. Just wanted to pass on to your investigation team what a fantastic job the Canyon’s Patrol did coordinating the initial rescue effort. It was a difficult and potentially dangerous situation that they handled extremely well. It was evident that safety was their number one priority, not just for their own personnel but for those of us called in to assist. They also had to consider the safety of bystanders and the victim’s party who were attempting a partner rescue. There were several variables to consider in the cost versus benefit analysis faced by those running the incident. Having experienced and organized incident commanders with well thought out strategic plans and back-ups allowed the operation to unfold without further incident or harm to all involved. Without addressing the victims own personal preparedness, I don’t think there was anything that could have been done that would have changed the ultimate outcome. The Canyon’s Patrol and the Summit County SO team should be commended for outstanding work performed in a stressful, challenging and extremely difficult environment. Take care and be safe! Cheers,",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "3 Skiers approached Mt Aire from Lambs Canyon, Wednesday morning January 25. They ascended a North-South running ridge on Mt Aire and experienced at least one collapse in low angle terrain during the approach. They skied an East aspect off the ridge and did not report any collapsing or cracking. They switched to the West side of the ridge on a slope with a NW aspect. Skier 1 descended and continued to the trailhead. Skier 2 triggered the slide, but skier 1 did not know this. Skier 2 was caught and carried approximately 75 feet downhill to some trees but was not buried and not injured. Skier 3 descended to perform a rescue.\n\nSkier 2 was ok. Because they did not see skier 1, they assumed he was buried. They performed a beacon search but did not receive a signal. They reported that Skier 1 had been having some sort of trouble with his beacon this year; therefore, they assumed he was buried but his beacon was not working. At that point, they called 911 to get help. With no beacon signal, Skier's 2 & 3 and began probing areas with a high probability of burial (like the uphill side of trees). They scoured every inch of debris continuing to probe all likely areas. As they worked closer to the toe of the debris, they spotted skier 1's ski tracks which were not obvious. They followed his tracks to the trail head and discovered he was ok. While skiing back to the trail head, another avalanche was triggered on buried surface hoar.\n\nWe at the UAC are all very happy no one was injured or killed. We are also very appreciative that members of the party were very open and willing to talk about this incident so that the rest of us can learn and be safer. Avalanches are stressful and confusing events. What is important in this scenario is that they exposed only one person at a time to the avalanche terrain. Despite the confusion, only one person was caught. Skier 2 was lucky to have avoided trauma. Even small avalanches moving slowly can cause serious trauma. Running into a tree a 20 mph (which is slow for an avalanche) can hurt.",

Surface hoar just like frost on a car windshield except it is very fragile and can easily be destroyed by wind or sunshine. Winds began to increase on Wednesday night (1/18) and into Thursday morning (1/19), before diminishing midday on Thursday. At the Reynolds Peak wind station at 9400 ft, winds blew generally from the S and SSW 10-15 mph with only slightly stronger gusts. A the Parleys Summit weather station at 7000 ft, the strongest winds blew 10 mph gusting to 15 mph from a generally westerly direction. In contrast, winds at 11,000 ft in Little Cottonwood Canyon briefly blew 30 mph gusting to 50 mph from the S.\n\nA weak storm system deposited 3-5\" in the Salt Lake mountains on Thursday. This snow capped and preserved this surface hoar layer on sheltered slopes where it wasn't destroyed by the wind. Snowfall since Thursday contained 1.8 inches of water at the Parleys Summit SNOTEL site at 7500 ft just north of Summit Park and I-80. Snowfall since Thursday contained 2.08 inches of water at the Spruces weather station at 7400 ft in Big Cottonwood Canyon. On the day of the accident, we found 18-26 inches of snow on top of the surface hoar layer which corresponds well to these water numbers.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "I was skiing alone, coming back into Little Cottonwood Canyon from Cardiac Bowl after a long and very enjoyable morning of skiing mostly north and some east facing classic Wasatch powder. I gained the ridgeline at the Little Superior Buttress, and decided to make my descent from just above it. As I removed my skins up on the ridge, I examined the slope below. The initial portion of the run dropped about 100 feet south east facing before opening up into a broader bowl above a rock band. My intention was to make my way skiers left over to the frequently skied fin that drops from just below the buttress.\n As I gained the more south facing open bowl above the rock band, I noticed a large number of roller balls and debris coming down from above. The next thing I knew, I was in the middle of a large wet slab avalanche. I suppose the release knocked me down, but at first it seemed like the slab was moving slowly. it started gaining speed as it carried me towards a funnel through the rock band. Unfortunately I was on my back with my legs and skis above me. I was unable to move to right myself and I realized I was going over the rock band, headfirst. The snow was so dense that I easily floated on top. It was like riding a 2 foot thick churning carpet of roller balls and slush. I believe it protected me from the rocks as I went backwards over the probably 20' rock band.\nIt certainly cushioned the blow as I came down on the slope below. Once over the rock band, the slide continued to gain speed. I had only one ski and one pole still with me, but I managed to get an edge into the sliding snow. I fought hard with the remaining pole and my free arm to get off of the slide to skier's left, just before it poured over the choke of a second and slightly taller rock band. For what seemed like a really long time, more than a minute for sure, the wet slide just kept pouring down from above and through the choke.\nWith the slide over, I waited for the adrenaline rush to subside somewhat and determined that I didn't have any serious injuries. I dialed 911 to alert Alta Central about the slide and that nobody had been buried in it. As I down climbed the rock band, kicking toeholds into the remaining snow, I punched through a few places to reveal a virtual waterfall- 3-4\" of running water below the snow surface.\nAnother 200 feet or so below, the slide had come to a stop in a broad tongue of debris 2-3 feet deep. My lost pole and ski were easily retrieved from their final resting places atop the debris pile. Making my way down to them, the bed surface was a moistened, but still bulletproof sun crust- completely scoured of the weekend's new snow. It wasn't until the low angle apron just above the road that I ever noted the snow surface to be getting damp and manky.\n\nForecaster Note: It's unknown if this was a wet loose sluff, or perhaps a slab. So we've classified it as a Storm Snow slide.",

We skied one run and on the second run the first skier dropped in and made 4 turns and just beyond the crest a 2- 2 1/2 foot fracture 80-100 feet wide broke loose. He rode it down almost buried (only head visable) and it came to a stop 100-120 yards down. He was buried up to waist and was able to dig out on own. \nOvercast, foggy, no wind around 30 degrees.\n\nSnow was medium weight powder on top 2 feet and the slope angle was around 35-40 degree where the fracture occured. The debre at the bottom of slide was 3-4 feet deep. \nThe slide let loose slowly--did no hear anything.\nNone\nNo new snow and it did not appear to be much wind loading.\nI would pass by this line in the future.\n\nYour Avalanche forcast for the day describes very much what happend in this incident. I can send photos later if you would like. Also the slide is visible from the top of the Milli lift.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "With permission and from Mark White's Blog : \"Today we headed up Butler Fork thinking that we would stay out of the wind and ski a sheltered NE facing bowl at around 9,000ft. We realized the snow was denser than expected and slightly inverted on our hike in but we stayed out of the wind and never felt any slabby snow. This bowl is steep at the top, 38 plus degrees, then mellows out rapidly in the middle. We ascended in the steep trees on skiers right side, did a ski cut that only produced sluffing and skied the bowl with no obvious instabilities. We proceeded to hike up again but this time went up about 10 feet higher, still on the edge of the trees. My partner was about 10 feet in front of me and stomped out a flat spot to take his skins off, next thing we know the bowl is fracturing 50ft above us. My partner was on the edge of the slide and just got pushed 2 feet. I was in the middle, got pushed into a stand of trees and got buried to the top of my chest. I also heard and felt my hamstring pop. I was still in hiking mode with toes locked in and skins on with my legs all twisted up. It required my partner to dig me out and release my skis from my feet. A few minutes after I was out we heard a pop and the middle of the bowl pulled out remotely. The first slide was 100ft wide, 18 inches at the deepest point. The next slide extended the crown to 250ft and ran to where the slope flattened out. I doubt we would’ve triggered a slide if we would have stayed lower out of the windslab. The windslab wasn’t obvious but it only makes sense in retrospect. There’s a massive cornice at the top and while the wind wasn’t out of hand it was still loading the slope right below the cornice with denser snow. Sometimes the line between triggering a slide and not is thin but it sucks to be on the wrong side of that line. Just glad I had a good partner with me and can ski on one leg fairly efficiently. Mistakes were definitely made but we live and hopefully learn from them.\"\n\n \n\n ",

About 2.7 miles from the parking lot they started to divert off the main trail and ascend toward a ridge. They were making switchbacks up a slope when they triggered an avalanche. The avalanche propagated about 300 feet above them. One skier was able to grab a tree and avoid taking the ride which the other skier did. He took about a 300 foot ride and was strained through some aspens and completely buried near the toe. His partner who did not go for a ride located him with an avalanche transceiver and dug him out from under about 4 feet of snow. He was uninjured and they were able to return to the parking lot on their own.",

Another point of interest is that he was wearing a avalanche air bag and did not deploy it, not sure if he was getting trundled too hard to pull the cord or what happened, hopefully he will send in a report and give us some first hand information. in a report",

Neither ski areas are open yet and have yet to conduct any avalanche control within their boundaries. We interviewed the victim's ski partner. To say he was shaken up is an understatement. \n\nWhile neither had any rescue gear or formal avalanche training, they were both expert skiers and knew the terrain well. They had not consulted the avalanche advisory that morning in which the danger was rated Considerable to High. They continued to Snowbird via Baldy and accessed the Peruvian Cirque to gain the Gad Valley. While ascending out of the Peruvian Cirque they remotely triggered a large avalanche that covered their tracks that they had just made. It's unclear whether they realized they had triggered this large avalanche. They gained the ridge and prepared to drop into Gad Valley.\n\nWith the partner watching, the victim dropped into the slope, immediately triggering the slide. He was carried approximately 800 feet through steep rocky terrain and reportedly went over a small cliff band and came to a stop only partially buried. The partner went down to help the victim and called for a rescue, alerting both the Snowbird Ski Patrol and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, who subsequently accessed and evacuated the victim. ",

You always hear people say, that will never happen to me. Unfortunately, you never know. It’s a risk we take every day in the backcountry.\n\n \n\nWe were extremely lucky today. We happened to be in the wrong place. A slide was triggered and one of our friends was caught and carried. He fought to stay on top of the snow headed downhill head first. His sled was stopped by a big pine tree and buried pretty deep. He got separated from his sled and continued down to the next tree. This is where Curtis found him within a minute or so. His hand was out of the snow. Curtis started digging to clear his airways. Justin was talking, while Curtis worked to get him the rest of the way out. His adrenaline kicked in and was going as soon as Curtis got him out.\n\n\nDid we make mistakes today? Maybe. But we also did everything we have been trained to do. We checked the UAC forecast, we had our gear and used our training to make it home safe.\n\n ",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "When a party of four riders entered the bowl from the top it was completely untracked and nice smooth powder. The east facing slope south of Saint Charles Peak is committing because there is no good way to ride out the bottom, so you have to come back up the hill in order to exit the drainage. The party played around on adjacent slopes and two had successfully climbed back out of the 36 degree slope a few times. \n\nThe slope had several tracks in it at the time of the avalanche. One rider climbed to the saddle on the top and watched, and a second was at the bottom also watching as the third attempted the climb. On the second attempt, the 47-year-old rider's sled did not have quite enough power to make the climb, and he turned near the top of the slope. The snow on the slope fractured even as the rider guided his sled in a rightward arc back down the hill. \n\nThe avalanche caught rider and sled near the south flank and a large rock held up the sled for a bit while the rider was carried (he mentioned using swimming motions) to near the toe at the bottom of the avalanche, ending up about 150' below his sled, face-down and partially buried in the debris. The fourth rider was below on the slope and heading up when the slope fractured. He decided to keep his sled pointed up the hill and rode on top of the slab, the throttle pegged, track spinning like a treadmill as the slab ran underneath, leaving him safely on the bed surface. \n\nThe other riders were able to get down to the lucky survivor and had him out of a face-down partial burial quite quickly. He was quickly spotted by his companions, and they had him out of the debris in \"really only a couple minutes.\" Thankfully, now He is mainly only shaken, and recovering from minor injuries. The sled was damaged in the avalanche, but the party repaired it in the field the next day and rode it out of the hole. \n\n ",

The rescue ended up going on well into the night, and involved about 50 rescuers from Cache, Franklin, and Bear Lake Counties. Read Report\n\nThe same slope was the site of a tragic fatality on February 19, 2000. Read Report \n\nThe avalanche occurred on a mostly east facing slope and started at around 9200' in elevation. The toe of the avalanche was at around 8700'. The slope measures only about 36 degrees in steepness in the steepest area, and I measured the Alpha angle of this avalanche at 25 degrees.",

The slide was triggered at the steep break over at the top of the rib, and the portion that the skier was caught in was about 60' wide and 2 feet deep. However, the slide was able to propagate to skiers left, into part of an adjacent gully, where it was closer to 90 feet wide, and entrained much more snow.

The two companions quickly got to the victim and quickly revived the victim. According to a second-hand account, the skier tried to grab a tree (see the photo of the glove attached to the tree) and was able to do so for a few seconds before being carried. This may have helped save them from being carried more deeply into the debris. The crown of the avalanche was 12-24\" deep and the avalanche propagated widely - over 600' and across two other drainages. This was a very large and dangerous avalanche with a fortunate outcome.\n\n ",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "3 skiers left Snowbird boundary into a backcountry area of Scottie's Bowl. One skier caught, carried and appeared to dislocate both shoulders.\nUDOT will look at the slide and we will post what they find.\nHere is a post on the TGR forum by the victim, which I reprint with permission after talking to him on the phone today.\nskibum is most likely referring to me... skied supe with telethor, tt's cousin and whapworth this morning, what an amazing run that is. great snow, noticed some debris in the usual spots but nothing too scary. left those guys at the bottom to go ski the bird with a buddy, and had a great day there too. about 2-3pm, i decided to ski out to white pine with a couple guys, one happened to be a coach for the SB freeski team and longtime ripper so i was confident following his lead, especially after our amazing run down sketchier SE superior. we skied to the very top of scotty's, scoped a little, and he dropped first, noticing sloughing but nothing much. since it was N facing and i was thinking it had been pretty cold with inconsistent sun all day, wet slabs were the last thing in my mind, and breaking off a deep slab was also not really something i was worried about. i dropped second in our party of three. made 2-3 turns on the spine i dropped on, and then got the feeling something wasn't right. figured some slough was chasing me, tried to stay high on the shoulder, but a BIG slab had ripped out above and around me. the rest is a blur, but i got taken in the 500-1000 foot range down the slope, maybe 2-300 vert. couldn't get my avalung in, as i think my shoulders had already popped from swimming when i went for it, my head went under a few times, and i came very close to numerous large trees. ended up in the open area underneath, with a bit of snow over my legs (whice were above my head), but head and most of body up. both skis/poles were apparently gone (partner found 2 skis 1 pole), and my shoulders were both completely dislocated, but i was up and OK. later on in the clinic (I somehow managed to avoid a chopper ride and skied the final ~1500 vert out, hunched over and in some serious pain) i heard it was 3-4 feet at the crown, and 200 feet wide. no idea how deep the debris was, though it didn't seem very deep where i ended up, but with the amount of snow that came down i am sure it could have buried me (my partner was luckily around 100 feet away from my resting place). it was by far the scariest moment of my entire life, and by sheer luck, and maybe a bit of help from the swimming, i made it, but it could have very easily turned out differently had i smashed one of the large trees or ended up in a different spot in the debris. i don't know if it was stupidity in not recognizing the significant warming from morning to afternoon, or an anomaly that i happened to strike in just the right place, but regardless i am thankful to be alive and happy no one else was involved. i plan on calling the UAC tomorrow and giving them my full account of what happened (i got home from the OR, where they had to completely get me under to get my L shoulder back in, around midnight tonight), and am very interested to read the full report. i learned a sobering lesson the hard way, but am lucky to live to ski another day, though i have a feeling it is going to take awhile for me to feel comfortable beyond the boundaries again. be careful out there guys, i am surprised and grateful that after my ride on a day when people were getting after much bigger stuff then scotty's, no one else was apparently injured or worse.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "Two skiers, a 50 year old male (Tyson Bradley) working as lead guide and a 49 year old client (Douglas Green), were backcountry skiing in the Mill A drainage of Big Cottonwood Canyon. They were part of a group of 8 containing 3 guides and 5 clients who ascended Gobbler's ridge via Baker pass. They observed a size 2.5 (destructive scale) natural avalanche from the previous day on an east facing slope on Mt. Raymond but no cracking, collapsing or other signs of instability on the day of the accident.\n\nBradley and one client descended a south facing avalanche path west of and adjacent to the path of the fatal avalanche. After this run the client left the area because he had a meeting in town at 12:30 p.m. They skied the slope without incident while the rest of the group skied a north westerly facing, treed slope known as the “Benign Line.”\n\nAfter the first run Bradley re-ascended the ridge and approached the top of the run called Whitesnake. He was joined by three others, one of whom was Douglas Green, and an apprentice guide. The third guide and one other client skied the “Benign Line” again.\n\nBradley dropped into the Whitesnake path, made a few ski cuts, and stopped 300' downhill at an island of safety on skier’s right about a foot above and to the side of where the avalanche released (see photo). He directed Green to ski to him. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run. After regrouping, Bradley began skiing again and directed Green to remain where they had stopped. While skiing the next section, the guide felt the slope collapse (which is the weak layer failing just before the avalanche releases). At the same time he noticed Green had started skiing as well. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run.\n\nBradley was caught in the avalanche but continued moving right. He impacted a tree and was pushed upward by the avalanche but not carried downhill. He was partially buried and sustained minor injuries. Green was carried downhill and fully buried. He inflated his avalanche air-bag backpack at some point during the avalanche.\n\nAfter extricating himself from avalanche debris, Bradley skied down the scoured avalanche path and around an exposed rock band where he triggered a small avalanche. He started a beacon search at the edge of the avalanche debris. After covering several hundred yards of debris, he acquired the Green’s signal. His beacon indicated a distance of 77 meters. At the burial location the smallest distance displayed by his beacon was 0.9 meters. He pinpointed Green’s exact location with an avalanche probe.\n\nGreen was fully buried on his side with his head approximately 3 feet deep and his body approximately 4-5 feet. His avalanche airbag was inflated. Maximum debris depth was 15 feet. Bradley dug him out of the debris and began CPR. He could not find a pulse. The apprentice guide and two other skiers arrived about a minute after Bradley began digging. They assisted in the exhausting work of digging Green out of the debris. The avalanche was reported at 14:30 to Alta Central Dispatch by the third guide. A medical helicopter landed and evacuated both the Bradley and Green to a hospital in Salt Lake City where Green was pronounced deceased.\n\nThe enormous debris pile snapped aspen trees and covered the terrain trap gully below the avalanche path for hundreds of yards. There was no stauchwall or lower boundary of the avalanche because the slab covering the entire slope released, creating an enormous amount of avalanche debris. The avalanche - estimated at 1-2' deep and 600' wide, pulled down every bit of snow between the starting zone near the ridge at 10,000' and well into the gulley at 9000'. The alpha angle, the angle from the toe of the debris to the crown, was 22 degrees.\n\nThe Utah Avalanche Center rated the avalanche danger in this terrain as Considerable and had issued an Avalanche Warning on January 21, 2016. See danger rose and bottom line below from that day’s advisory.\n\n\n\n“There [are] many weak layers and issues that will cause avalanches today. All the red flags are present. Widespread recent avalanche activity both natural and human triggered, recent snow and strong winds, widespread faceted layers in the snowpack, and today will have strong sunshine and temperatures possibly going above freezing. All these factors combine to make very dangerous avalanche conditions and a HIGH avalanche danger.”\n\nThe full advisory from that day can be found at:\n\nhttps://utahavalanchecenter.org/advisory/salt-lake/01/21/2016\n\n ",

The starting zone aspects ran from 107 degrees ESE to 215 degrees SSW. The upper starting zone was cross-loaded from strong west to northwest winds in the late evening of January 19 into January 20. Slope angles across the crown were not measured as conditions remained too hazardous to access the fracture line, though the starting zone is estimated at 35-37 degrees.

        "Weather Conditions and History": "The weather has been complex this winter. November’s snow was followed by a long, dry spell with only small, intermittent snow storms through early December. Periodic cold temperatures and clear skies faceted the shallow snowpack on shady slopes during this time. A series of storms between December 12th and 25th added several feet of snow to the snow pack and led to a major avalanche cycle.\n\nWeather events became even more complex in January. The New Year was ushered in with a strong southeasterly wind event that scoured and loaded unusual aspects, producing another avalanche cycle. This was followed by small, almost daily storms between January 3rd and 8th. A dry spell between January 9th and 13th, with warm sunny days and clear cold nights, developed near surface facets on shady slopes and created ice crusts on top of faceted snow on solar aspects.\n\nBetween January 14th and 20th, snow fell six out of seven days, culminating on January 20th with strong southwest to northwesterly winds, dense heavy snow and an active avalanche cycle. Snow totals from Big Cottonwood and the Park City side ranged from 7” to 11\" on the 20th, with storm water equivalents of .65\" to 1.04\". The Mill D North SNOTEL site had similar SWE numbers.\n\nJanuary 21st had sunny skies and temperatures ranging from near 10 degrees F into the low 20s.",

More details may be added later if it is possible to interview the survivor.\n\nThe accident occurred in Dutch Draw, a backcountry area south of the Canyons Resort.\n\nTimothy and his partner were on snowboards. They left through the well marked boundary gate at the top of 9990 Lift and traversed south It is believed both the victim and his partner descended about 150 or 200’ below the ridgeline and stopped near the cliffs. Then Timothy descended the next section first, triggered a slab avalanche. He was caught, carried and buried. Neither he nor his partner were wearing a beacon or had rescue gear.\n\nRescue: Timothy’s partner immediately headed down to the debris and started searching. As other backcountry travelers in adjacent area came into view, he called out for help, and a total of 8 people arrived. One was sent for help. The other 7 people searched the debris. None of the parties were equipped with beacons or rescue gear. Some skiers popped the baskets off their poles and probed. One struck the victim’s snowboard and they started digging just as 2 Canyons ski patrollers arrived on the scene. Timothy was dug out, and a ski patroller and Timothy’s partner started CPR. They transported the victim to a nearby flat area where a medical helicopter could land and transport the victim to the hospital. The victim was buried about 40 minutes. It is unknown if he died from trauma or asphyxiation.\n\nThe victim was carried about 600 vertical feet, strained through small trees, and buried near the toe of the slide. He buried head first downhill, face down, with his head approximately 3 feet below the snow surface in debris that was about 6 to 8 feet deep. The snowboard was broken in half, but held together by some of the material. \n\n \n\nemail from Jay Torgersen, Flight Paramedic, AirMed\n\nI was on the AirMed team that responded to the Canyons and worked with their Patrol on the side-country accident/fatality yesterday. Our team was made up of Casey Thompson-RN, Troy Stanton-Pilot and myself. Just wanted to pass on to your investigation team what a fantastic job the Canyon’s Patrol did coordinating the initial rescue effort. It was a difficult and potentially dangerous situation that they handled extremely well. It was evident that safety was their number one priority, not just for their own personnel but for those of us called in to assist. They also had to consider the safety of bystanders and the victim’s party who were attempting a partner rescue. There were several variables to consider in the cost versus benefit analysis faced by those running the incident. Having experienced and organized incident commanders with well thought out strategic plans and back-ups allowed the operation to unfold without further incident or harm to all involved. Without addressing the victims own personal preparedness, I don’t think there was anything that could have been done that would have changed the ultimate outcome. The Canyon’s Patrol and the Summit County SO team should be commended for outstanding work performed in a stressful, challenging and extremely difficult environment. Take care and be safe! Cheers,",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "3 Skiers approached Mt Aire from Lambs Canyon, Wednesday morning January 25. They ascended a North-South running ridge on Mt Aire and experienced at least one collapse in low angle terrain during the approach. They skied an East aspect off the ridge and did not report any collapsing or cracking. They switched to the West side of the ridge on a slope with a NW aspect. Skier 1 descended and continued to the trailhead. Skier 2 triggered the slide, but skier 1 did not know this. Skier 2 was caught and carried approximately 75 feet downhill to some trees but was not buried and not injured. Skier 3 descended to perform a rescue.\n\nSkier 2 was ok. Because they did not see skier 1, they assumed he was buried. They performed a beacon search but did not receive a signal. They reported that Skier 1 had been having some sort of trouble with his beacon this year; therefore, they assumed he was buried but his beacon was not working. At that point, they called 911 to get help. With no beacon signal, Skier's 2 & 3 and began probing areas with a high probability of burial (like the uphill side of trees). They scoured every inch of debris continuing to probe all likely areas. As they worked closer to the toe of the debris, they spotted skier 1's ski tracks which were not obvious. They followed his tracks to the trail head and discovered he was ok. While skiing back to the trail head, another avalanche was triggered on buried surface hoar.\n\nWe at the UAC are all very happy no one was injured or killed. We are also very appreciative that members of the party were very open and willing to talk about this incident so that the rest of us can learn and be safer. Avalanches are stressful and confusing events. What is important in this scenario is that they exposed only one person at a time to the avalanche terrain. Despite the confusion, only one person was caught. Skier 2 was lucky to have avoided trauma. Even small avalanches moving slowly can cause serious trauma. Running into a tree a 20 mph (which is slow for an avalanche) can hurt.",

Surface hoar just like frost on a car windshield except it is very fragile and can easily be destroyed by wind or sunshine. Winds began to increase on Wednesday night (1/18) and into Thursday morning (1/19), before diminishing midday on Thursday. At the Reynolds Peak wind station at 9400 ft, winds blew generally from the S and SSW 10-15 mph with only slightly stronger gusts. A the Parleys Summit weather station at 7000 ft, the strongest winds blew 10 mph gusting to 15 mph from a generally westerly direction. In contrast, winds at 11,000 ft in Little Cottonwood Canyon briefly blew 30 mph gusting to 50 mph from the S.\n\nA weak storm system deposited 3-5\" in the Salt Lake mountains on Thursday. This snow capped and preserved this surface hoar layer on sheltered slopes where it wasn't destroyed by the wind. Snowfall since Thursday contained 1.8 inches of water at the Parleys Summit SNOTEL site at 7500 ft just north of Summit Park and I-80. Snowfall since Thursday contained 2.08 inches of water at the Spruces weather station at 7400 ft in Big Cottonwood Canyon. On the day of the accident, we found 18-26 inches of snow on top of the surface hoar layer which corresponds well to these water numbers.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "I was skiing alone, coming back into Little Cottonwood Canyon from Cardiac Bowl after a long and very enjoyable morning of skiing mostly north and some east facing classic Wasatch powder. I gained the ridgeline at the Little Superior Buttress, and decided to make my descent from just above it. As I removed my skins up on the ridge, I examined the slope below. The initial portion of the run dropped about 100 feet south east facing before opening up into a broader bowl above a rock band. My intention was to make my way skiers left over to the frequently skied fin that drops from just below the buttress.\n As I gained the more south facing open bowl above the rock band, I noticed a large number of roller balls and debris coming down from above. The next thing I knew, I was in the middle of a large wet slab avalanche. I suppose the release knocked me down, but at first it seemed like the slab was moving slowly. it started gaining speed as it carried me towards a funnel through the rock band. Unfortunately I was on my back with my legs and skis above me. I was unable to move to right myself and I realized I was going over the rock band, headfirst. The snow was so dense that I easily floated on top. It was like riding a 2 foot thick churning carpet of roller balls and slush. I believe it protected me from the rocks as I went backwards over the probably 20' rock band.\nIt certainly cushioned the blow as I came down on the slope below. Once over the rock band, the slide continued to gain speed. I had only one ski and one pole still with me, but I managed to get an edge into the sliding snow. I fought hard with the remaining pole and my free arm to get off of the slide to skier's left, just before it poured over the choke of a second and slightly taller rock band. For what seemed like a really long time, more than a minute for sure, the wet slide just kept pouring down from above and through the choke.\nWith the slide over, I waited for the adrenaline rush to subside somewhat and determined that I didn't have any serious injuries. I dialed 911 to alert Alta Central about the slide and that nobody had been buried in it. As I down climbed the rock band, kicking toeholds into the remaining snow, I punched through a few places to reveal a virtual waterfall- 3-4\" of running water below the snow surface.\nAnother 200 feet or so below, the slide had come to a stop in a broad tongue of debris 2-3 feet deep. My lost pole and ski were easily retrieved from their final resting places atop the debris pile. Making my way down to them, the bed surface was a moistened, but still bulletproof sun crust- completely scoured of the weekend's new snow. It wasn't until the low angle apron just above the road that I ever noted the snow surface to be getting damp and manky.\n\nForecaster Note: It's unknown if this was a wet loose sluff, or perhaps a slab. So we've classified it as a Storm Snow slide.",

We skied one run and on the second run the first skier dropped in and made 4 turns and just beyond the crest a 2- 2 1/2 foot fracture 80-100 feet wide broke loose. He rode it down almost buried (only head visable) and it came to a stop 100-120 yards down. He was buried up to waist and was able to dig out on own. \nOvercast, foggy, no wind around 30 degrees.\n\nSnow was medium weight powder on top 2 feet and the slope angle was around 35-40 degree where the fracture occured. The debre at the bottom of slide was 3-4 feet deep. \nThe slide let loose slowly--did no hear anything.\nNone\nNo new snow and it did not appear to be much wind loading.\nI would pass by this line in the future.\n\nYour Avalanche forcast for the day describes very much what happend in this incident. I can send photos later if you would like. Also the slide is visible from the top of the Milli lift.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "With permission and from Mark White's Blog : \"Today we headed up Butler Fork thinking that we would stay out of the wind and ski a sheltered NE facing bowl at around 9,000ft. We realized the snow was denser than expected and slightly inverted on our hike in but we stayed out of the wind and never felt any slabby snow. This bowl is steep at the top, 38 plus degrees, then mellows out rapidly in the middle. We ascended in the steep trees on skiers right side, did a ski cut that only produced sluffing and skied the bowl with no obvious instabilities. We proceeded to hike up again but this time went up about 10 feet higher, still on the edge of the trees. My partner was about 10 feet in front of me and stomped out a flat spot to take his skins off, next thing we know the bowl is fracturing 50ft above us. My partner was on the edge of the slide and just got pushed 2 feet. I was in the middle, got pushed into a stand of trees and got buried to the top of my chest. I also heard and felt my hamstring pop. I was still in hiking mode with toes locked in and skins on with my legs all twisted up. It required my partner to dig me out and release my skis from my feet. A few minutes after I was out we heard a pop and the middle of the bowl pulled out remotely. The first slide was 100ft wide, 18 inches at the deepest point. The next slide extended the crown to 250ft and ran to where the slope flattened out. I doubt we would’ve triggered a slide if we would have stayed lower out of the windslab. The windslab wasn’t obvious but it only makes sense in retrospect. There’s a massive cornice at the top and while the wind wasn’t out of hand it was still loading the slope right below the cornice with denser snow. Sometimes the line between triggering a slide and not is thin but it sucks to be on the wrong side of that line. Just glad I had a good partner with me and can ski on one leg fairly efficiently. Mistakes were definitely made but we live and hopefully learn from them.\"\n\n \n\n ",

About 2.7 miles from the parking lot they started to divert off the main trail and ascend toward a ridge. They were making switchbacks up a slope when they triggered an avalanche. The avalanche propagated about 300 feet above them. One skier was able to grab a tree and avoid taking the ride which the other skier did. He took about a 300 foot ride and was strained through some aspens and completely buried near the toe. His partner who did not go for a ride located him with an avalanche transceiver and dug him out from under about 4 feet of snow. He was uninjured and they were able to return to the parking lot on their own.",

Neither ski areas are open yet and have yet to conduct any avalanche control within their boundaries. We interviewed the victim's ski partner. To say he was shaken up is an understatement. \n\nWhile neither had any rescue gear or formal avalanche training, they were both expert skiers and knew the terrain well. They had not consulted the avalanche advisory that morning in which the danger was rated Considerable to High. They continued to Snowbird via Baldy and accessed the Peruvian Cirque to gain the Gad Valley. While ascending out of the Peruvian Cirque they remotely triggered a large avalanche that covered their tracks that they had just made. It's unclear whether they realized they had triggered this large avalanche. They gained the ridge and prepared to drop into Gad Valley.\n\nWith the partner watching, the victim dropped into the slope, immediately triggering the slide. He was carried approximately 800 feet through steep rocky terrain and reportedly went over a small cliff band and came to a stop only partially buried. The partner went down to help the victim and called for a rescue, alerting both the Snowbird Ski Patrol and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, who subsequently accessed and evacuated the victim. ",

You always hear people say, that will never happen to me. Unfortunately, you never know. It’s a risk we take every day in the backcountry.\n\n \n\nWe were extremely lucky today. We happened to be in the wrong place. A slide was triggered and one of our friends was caught and carried. He fought to stay on top of the snow headed downhill head first. His sled was stopped by a big pine tree and buried pretty deep. He got separated from his sled and continued down to the next tree. This is where Curtis found him within a minute or so. His hand was out of the snow. Curtis started digging to clear his airways. Justin was talking, while Curtis worked to get him the rest of the way out. His adrenaline kicked in and was going as soon as Curtis got him out.\n\n\nDid we make mistakes today? Maybe. But we also did everything we have been trained to do. We checked the UAC forecast, we had our gear and used our training to make it home safe.\n\n ",

The east facing slope south of Saint Charles Peak is committing because there is no good way to ride out the bottom, so you have to come back up the hill in order to exit the drainage. The party played around on adjacent slopes and two had successfully climbed back out of the 36 degree slope a few times. \n\nThe slope had several tracks in it at the time of the avalanche. One rider climbed to the saddle on the top and watched, and a second was at the bottom also watching as the third attempted the climb. On the second attempt, the 47-year-old rider's sled did not have quite enough power to make the climb, and he turned near the top of the slope. The snow on the slope fractured even as the rider guided his sled in a rightward arc back down the hill. \n\nThe avalanche caught rider and sled near the south flank and a large rock held up the sled for a bit while the rider was carried (he mentioned using swimming motions) to near the toe at the bottom of the avalanche, ending up about 150' below his sled, face-down and partially buried in the debris. The fourth rider was below on the slope and heading up when the slope fractured. He decided to keep his sled pointed up the hill and rode on top of the slab, the throttle pegged, track spinning like a treadmill as the slab ran underneath, leaving him safely on the bed surface. \n\nThe other riders were able to get down to the lucky survivor and had him out of a face-down partial burial quite quickly. He was quickly spotted by his companions, and they had him out of the debris in \"really only a couple minutes.\" Thankfully, now He is mainly only shaken, and recovering from minor injuries. The sled was damaged in the avalanche, but the party repaired it in the field the next day and rode it out of the hole. \n\n ",

It is the site of an epic January 11, 2014 rescue, where a rider was fully buried, suffered a double femur fracture, and had to be hauled up 1600' by rope. The rescue ended up going on well into the night, and involved about 50 rescuers from Cache, Franklin, and Bear Lake Counties. Read Report\n\nThe same slope was the site of a tragic fatality on February 19, 2000. Read Report \n\nThe avalanche occurred on a mostly east facing slope and started at around 9200' in elevation. The toe of the avalanche was at around 8700'. The slope measures only about 36 degrees in steepness in the steepest area, and I measured the Alpha angle of this avalanche at 25 degrees.",

Turns out that with current snowpack conditions, the steeper section at the top of rib was able to slide, even though the rest of the rib didn't. The slide was triggered at the steep break over at the top of the rib, and the portion that the skier was caught in was about 60' wide and 2 feet deep. However, the slide was able to propagate to skiers left, into part of an adjacent gully, where it was closer to 90 feet wide, and entrained much more snow. Much of the rest of rib didn't slide, so there were two separate debris piles.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "3 skiers left Snowbird boundary into a backcountry area of Scottie's Bowl. One skier caught, carried and appeared to dislocate both shoulders.\nUDOT will look at the slide and we will post what they find.\nHere is a post on the TGR forum by the victim, which I reprint with permission after talking to him on the phone today.\nskibum is most likely referring to me... skied supe with telethor, tt's cousin and whapworth this morning, what an amazing run that is. great snow, noticed some debris in the usual spots but nothing too scary. left those guys at the bottom to go ski the bird with a buddy, and had a great day there too. about 2-3pm, i decided to ski out to white pine with a couple guys, one happened to be a coach for the SB freeski team and longtime ripper so i was confident following his lead, especially after our amazing run down sketchier SE superior. we skied to the very top of scotty's, scoped a little, and he dropped first, noticing sloughing but nothing much. since it was N facing and i was thinking it had been pretty cold with inconsistent sun all day, wet slabs were the last thing in my mind, and breaking off a deep slab was also not really something i was worried about. i dropped second in our party of three. made 2-3 turns on the spine i dropped on, and then got the feeling something wasn't right. figured some slough was chasing me, tried to stay high on the shoulder, but a BIG slab had ripped out above and around me. the rest is a blur, but i got taken in the 500-1000 foot range down the slope, maybe 2-300 vert. couldn't get my avalung in, as i think my shoulders had already popped from swimming when i went for it, my head went under a few times, and i came very close to numerous large trees. ended up in the open area underneath, with a bit of snow over my legs (whice were above my head), but head and most of body up. both skis/poles were apparently gone (partner found 2 skis 1 pole), and my shoulders were both completely dislocated, but i was up and OK. later on in the clinic (I somehow managed to avoid a chopper ride and skied the final ~1500 vert out, hunched over and in some serious pain) i heard it was 3-4 feet at the crown, and 200 feet wide. no idea how deep the debris was, though it didn't seem very deep where i ended up, but with the amount of snow that came down i am sure it could have buried me (my partner was luckily around 100 feet away from my resting place). it was by far the scariest moment of my entire life, and by sheer luck, and maybe a bit of help from the swimming, i made it, but it could have very easily turned out differently had i smashed one of the large trees or ended up in a different spot in the debris. i don't know if it was stupidity in not recognizing the significant warming from morning to afternoon, or an anomaly that i happened to strike in just the right place, but regardless i am thankful to be alive and happy no one else was involved. i plan on calling the UAC tomorrow and giving them my full account of what happened (i got home from the OR, where they had to completely get me under to get my L shoulder back in, around midnight tonight), and am very interested to read the full report. i learned a sobering lesson the hard way, but am lucky to live to ski another day, though i have a feeling it is going to take awhile for me to feel comfortable beyond the boundaries again. be careful out there guys, i am surprised and grateful that after my ride on a day when people were getting after much bigger stuff then scotty's, no one else was apparently injured or worse.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "Two skiers, a 50 year old male (Tyson Bradley) working as lead guide and a 49 year old client (Douglas Green), were backcountry skiing in the Mill A drainage of Big Cottonwood Canyon. They were part of a group of 8 containing 3 guides and 5 clients who ascended Gobbler's ridge via Baker pass. They observed a size 2.5 (destructive scale) natural avalanche from the previous day on an east facing slope on Mt. Raymond but no cracking, collapsing or other signs of instability on the day of the accident.\n\nBradley and one client descended a south facing avalanche path west of and adjacent to the path of the fatal avalanche. After this run the client left the area because he had a meeting in town at 12:30 p.m. They skied the slope without incident while the rest of the group skied a north westerly facing, treed slope known as the “Benign Line.”\n\nAfter the first run Bradley re-ascended the ridge and approached the top of the run called Whitesnake. He was joined by three others, one of whom was Douglas Green, and an apprentice guide. The third guide and one other client skied the “Benign Line” again.\n\nBradley dropped into the Whitesnake path, made a few ski cuts, and stopped 300' downhill at an island of safety on skier’s right about a foot above and to the side of where the avalanche released (see photo). He directed Green to ski to him. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run. After regrouping, Bradley began skiing again and directed Green to remain where they had stopped. While skiing the next section, the guide felt the slope collapse (which is the weak layer failing just before the avalanche releases). At the same time he noticed Green had started skiing as well. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run.\n\nBradley was caught in the avalanche but continued moving right. He impacted a tree and was pushed upward by the avalanche but not carried downhill. He was partially buried and sustained minor injuries. Green was carried downhill and fully buried. He inflated his avalanche air-bag backpack at some point during the avalanche.\n\nAfter extricating himself from avalanche debris, Bradley skied down the scoured avalanche path and around an exposed rock band where he triggered a small avalanche. He started a beacon search at the edge of the avalanche debris. After covering several hundred yards of debris, he acquired the Green’s signal. His beacon indicated a distance of 77 meters. At the burial location the smallest distance displayed by his beacon was 0.9 meters. He pinpointed Green’s exact location with an avalanche probe.\n\nGreen was fully buried on his side with his head approximately 3 feet deep and his body approximately 4-5 feet. His avalanche airbag was inflated. Maximum debris depth was 15 feet. Bradley dug him out of the debris and began CPR. He could not find a pulse. The apprentice guide and two other skiers arrived about a minute after Bradley began digging. They assisted in the exhausting work of digging Green out of the debris. The avalanche was reported at 14:30 to Alta Central Dispatch by the third guide. A medical helicopter landed and evacuated both the Bradley and Green to a hospital in Salt Lake City where Green was pronounced deceased.\n\nThe enormous debris pile snapped aspen trees and covered the terrain trap gully below the avalanche path for hundreds of yards. There was no stauchwall or lower boundary of the avalanche because the slab covering the entire slope released, creating an enormous amount of avalanche debris. The avalanche - estimated at 1-2' deep and 600' wide, pulled down every bit of snow between the starting zone near the ridge at 10,000' and well into the gulley at 9000'. The alpha angle, the angle from the toe of the debris to the crown, was 22 degrees.\n\nThe Utah Avalanche Center rated the avalanche danger in this terrain as Considerable and had issued an Avalanche Warning on January 21, 2016. See danger rose and bottom line below from that day’s advisory.\n\n\n\n“There [are] many weak layers and issues that will cause avalanches today. All the red flags are present. Widespread recent avalanche activity both natural and human triggered, recent snow and strong winds, widespread faceted layers in the snowpack, and today will have strong sunshine and temperatures possibly going above freezing. All these factors combine to make very dangerous avalanche conditions and a HIGH avalanche danger.”\n\nThe full advisory from that day can be found at:\n\nhttps://utahavalanchecenter.org/advisory/salt-lake/01/21/2016\n\n ",

The starting zone aspects ran from 107 degrees ESE to 215 degrees SSW. The upper starting zone was cross-loaded from strong west to northwest winds in the late evening of January 19 into January 20. Slope angles across the crown were not measured as conditions remained too hazardous to access the fracture line, though the starting zone is estimated at 35-37 degrees.

        "Weather Conditions and History": "The weather has been complex this winter. November’s snow was followed by a long, dry spell with only small, intermittent snow storms through early December. Periodic cold temperatures and clear skies faceted the shallow snowpack on shady slopes during this time. A series of storms between December 12th and 25th added several feet of snow to the snow pack and led to a major avalanche cycle.\n\nWeather events became even more complex in January. The New Year was ushered in with a strong southeasterly wind event that scoured and loaded unusual aspects, producing another avalanche cycle. This was followed by small, almost daily storms between January 3rd and 8th. A dry spell between January 9th and 13th, with warm sunny days and clear cold nights, developed near surface facets on shady slopes and created ice crusts on top of faceted snow on solar aspects.\n\nBetween January 14th and 20th, snow fell six out of seven days, culminating on January 20th with strong southwest to northwesterly winds, dense heavy snow and an active avalanche cycle. Snow totals from Big Cottonwood and the Park City side ranged from 7” to 11\" on the 20th, with storm water equivalents of .65\" to 1.04\". The Mill D North SNOTEL site had similar SWE numbers.\n\nJanuary 21st had sunny skies and temperatures ranging from near 10 degrees F into the low 20s.",

Then Timothy descended the next section first, triggered a slab avalanche. He was caught, carried and buried. Neither he nor his partner were wearing a beacon or had rescue gear.\n\nRescue: Timothy’s partner immediately headed down to the debris and started searching. As other backcountry travelers in adjacent area came into view, he called out for help, and a total of 8 people arrived. One was sent for help. The other 7 people searched the debris. None of the parties were equipped with beacons or rescue gear. Some skiers popped the baskets off their poles and probed. One struck the victim’s snowboard and they started digging just as 2 Canyons ski patrollers arrived on the scene. Timothy was dug out, and a ski patroller and Timothy’s partner started CPR. They transported the victim to a nearby flat area where a medical helicopter could land and transport the victim to the hospital. The victim was buried about 40 minutes. It is unknown if he died from trauma or asphyxiation.\n\nThe victim was carried about 600 vertical feet, strained through small trees, and buried near the toe of the slide. He buried head first downhill, face down, with his head approximately 3 feet below the snow surface in debris that was about 6 to 8 feet deep. The snowboard was broken in half, but held together by some of the material. \n\n \n\nemail from Jay Torgersen, Flight Paramedic, AirMed\n\nI was on the AirMed team that responded to the Canyons and worked with their Patrol on the side-country accident/fatality yesterday. Our team was made up of Casey Thompson-RN, Troy Stanton-Pilot and myself. Just wanted to pass on to your investigation team what a fantastic job the Canyon’s Patrol did coordinating the initial rescue effort. It was a difficult and potentially dangerous situation that they handled extremely well. It was evident that safety was their number one priority, not just for their own personnel but for those of us called in to assist. They also had to consider the safety of bystanders and the victim’s party who were attempting a partner rescue. There were several variables to consider in the cost versus benefit analysis faced by those running the incident. Having experienced and organized incident commanders with well thought out strategic plans and back-ups allowed the operation to unfold without further incident or harm to all involved. Without addressing the victims own personal preparedness, I don’t think there was anything that could have been done that would have changed the ultimate outcome. The Canyon’s Patrol and the Summit County SO team should be commended for outstanding work performed in a stressful, challenging and extremely difficult environment. Take care and be safe! Cheers,",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "3 Skiers approached Mt Aire from Lambs Canyon, Wednesday morning January 25. They ascended a North-South running ridge on Mt Aire and experienced at least one collapse in low angle terrain during the approach. They skied an East aspect off the ridge and did not report any collapsing or cracking. They switched to the West side of the ridge on a slope with a NW aspect. Skier 1 descended and continued to the trailhead. Skier 2 triggered the slide, but skier 1 did not know this. Skier 2 was caught and carried approximately 75 feet downhill to some trees but was not buried and not injured. Skier 3 descended to perform a rescue.\n\nSkier 2 was ok. Because they did not see skier 1, they assumed he was buried. They performed a beacon search but did not receive a signal. They reported that Skier 1 had been having some sort of trouble with his beacon this year; therefore, they assumed he was buried but his beacon was not working. At that point, they called 911 to get help. With no beacon signal, Skier's 2 & 3 and began probing areas with a high probability of burial (like the uphill side of trees). They scoured every inch of debris continuing to probe all likely areas. As they worked closer to the toe of the debris, they spotted skier 1's ski tracks which were not obvious. They followed his tracks to the trail head and discovered he was ok. While skiing back to the trail head, another avalanche was triggered on buried surface hoar.\n\nWe at the UAC are all very happy no one was injured or killed. We are also very appreciative that members of the party were very open and willing to talk about this incident so that the rest of us can learn and be safer. Avalanches are stressful and confusing events. What is important in this scenario is that they exposed only one person at a time to the avalanche terrain. Despite the confusion, only one person was caught. Skier 2 was lucky to have avoided trauma. Even small avalanches moving slowly can cause serious trauma. Running into a tree a 20 mph (which is slow for an avalanche) can hurt.",

Surface hoar just like frost on a car windshield except it is very fragile and can easily be destroyed by wind or sunshine. Winds began to increase on Wednesday night (1/18) and into Thursday morning (1/19), before diminishing midday on Thursday. At the Reynolds Peak wind station at 9400 ft, winds blew generally from the S and SSW 10-15 mph with only slightly stronger gusts. A the Parleys Summit weather station at 7000 ft, the strongest winds blew 10 mph gusting to 15 mph from a generally westerly direction. In contrast, winds at 11,000 ft in Little Cottonwood Canyon briefly blew 30 mph gusting to 50 mph from the S.\n\nA weak storm system deposited 3-5\" in the Salt Lake mountains on Thursday. This snow capped and preserved this surface hoar layer on sheltered slopes where it wasn't destroyed by the wind. Snowfall since Thursday contained 1.8 inches of water at the Parleys Summit SNOTEL site at 7500 ft just north of Summit Park and I-80. Snowfall since Thursday contained 2.08 inches of water at the Spruces weather station at 7400 ft in Big Cottonwood Canyon. On the day of the accident, we found 18-26 inches of snow on top of the surface hoar layer which corresponds well to these water numbers.",

It is not known whether the person on rappel was clipped into the anchor or backed up with an autoblock above or below his rappel device. It is also not known whether the loose sluff was a natural or triggered from above. \n\nAfter the avalanche, both were able to make it down to the road unassisted. \n\nPhotos courtesy Stacee at Powderbird",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "I was skiing alone, coming back into Little Cottonwood Canyon from Cardiac Bowl after a long and very enjoyable morning of skiing mostly north and some east facing classic Wasatch powder. I gained the ridgeline at the Little Superior Buttress, and decided to make my descent from just above it. As I removed my skins up on the ridge, I examined the slope below. The initial portion of the run dropped about 100 feet south east facing before opening up into a broader bowl above a rock band. My intention was to make my way skiers left over to the frequently skied fin that drops from just below the buttress.\n As I gained the more south facing open bowl above the rock band, I noticed a large number of roller balls and debris coming down from above. The next thing I knew, I was in the middle of a large wet slab avalanche. I suppose the release knocked me down, but at first it seemed like the slab was moving slowly. it started gaining speed as it carried me towards a funnel through the rock band. Unfortunately I was on my back with my legs and skis above me. I was unable to move to right myself and I realized I was going over the rock band, headfirst. The snow was so dense that I easily floated on top. It was like riding a 2 foot thick churning carpet of roller balls and slush. I believe it protected me from the rocks as I went backwards over the probably 20' rock band.\nIt certainly cushioned the blow as I came down on the slope below. Once over the rock band, the slide continued to gain speed. I had only one ski and one pole still with me, but I managed to get an edge into the sliding snow. I fought hard with the remaining pole and my free arm to get off of the slide to skier's left, just before it poured over the choke of a second and slightly taller rock band. For what seemed like a really long time, more than a minute for sure, the wet slide just kept pouring down from above and through the choke.\nWith the slide over, I waited for the adrenaline rush to subside somewhat and determined that I didn't have any serious injuries. I dialed 911 to alert Alta Central about the slide and that nobody had been buried in it. As I down climbed the rock band, kicking toeholds into the remaining snow, I punched through a few places to reveal a virtual waterfall- 3-4\" of running water below the snow surface.\nAnother 200 feet or so below, the slide had come to a stop in a broad tongue of debris 2-3 feet deep. My lost pole and ski were easily retrieved from their final resting places atop the debris pile. Making my way down to them, the bed surface was a moistened, but still bulletproof sun crust- completely scoured of the weekend's new snow. It wasn't until the low angle apron just above the road that I ever noted the snow surface to be getting damp and manky.\n\nForecaster Note: It's unknown if this was a wet loose sluff, or perhaps a slab. So we've classified it as a Storm Snow slide.",

We skied one run and on the second run the first skier dropped in and made 4 turns and just beyond the crest a 2- 2 1/2 foot fracture 80-100 feet wide broke loose. He rode it down almost buried (only head visable) and it came to a stop 100-120 yards down. He was buried up to waist and was able to dig out on own. \nOvercast, foggy, no wind around 30 degrees.\n\nSnow was medium weight powder on top 2 feet and the slope angle was around 35-40 degree where the fracture occured. The debre at the bottom of slide was 3-4 feet deep. \nThe slide let loose slowly--did no hear anything.\nNone\nNo new snow and it did not appear to be much wind loading.\nI would pass by this line in the future.\n\nYour Avalanche forcast for the day describes very much what happend in this incident. I can send photos later if you would like. Also the slide is visible from the top of the Milli lift.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "With permission and from Mark White's Blog : \"Today we headed up Butler Fork thinking that we would stay out of the wind and ski a sheltered NE facing bowl at around 9,000ft. We realized the snow was denser than expected and slightly inverted on our hike in but we stayed out of the wind and never felt any slabby snow. This bowl is steep at the top, 38 plus degrees, then mellows out rapidly in the middle. We ascended in the steep trees on skiers right side, did a ski cut that only produced sluffing and skied the bowl with no obvious instabilities. We proceeded to hike up again but this time went up about 10 feet higher, still on the edge of the trees. My partner was about 10 feet in front of me and stomped out a flat spot to take his skins off, next thing we know the bowl is fracturing 50ft above us. My partner was on the edge of the slide and just got pushed 2 feet. I was in the middle, got pushed into a stand of trees and got buried to the top of my chest. I also heard and felt my hamstring pop. I was still in hiking mode with toes locked in and skins on with my legs all twisted up. It required my partner to dig me out and release my skis from my feet. A few minutes after I was out we heard a pop and the middle of the bowl pulled out remotely. The first slide was 100ft wide, 18 inches at the deepest point. The next slide extended the crown to 250ft and ran to where the slope flattened out. I doubt we would’ve triggered a slide if we would have stayed lower out of the windslab. The windslab wasn’t obvious but it only makes sense in retrospect. There’s a massive cornice at the top and while the wind wasn’t out of hand it was still loading the slope right below the cornice with denser snow. Sometimes the line between triggering a slide and not is thin but it sucks to be on the wrong side of that line. Just glad I had a good partner with me and can ski on one leg fairly efficiently. Mistakes were definitely made but we live and hopefully learn from them.\"\n\n \n\n ",

About 2.7 miles from the parking lot they started to divert off the main trail and ascend toward a ridge. They were making switchbacks up a slope when they triggered an avalanche. The avalanche propagated about 300 feet above them. One skier was able to grab a tree and avoid taking the ride which the other skier did. He took about a 300 foot ride and was strained through some aspens and completely buried near the toe. His partner who did not go for a ride located him with an avalanche transceiver and dug him out from under about 4 feet of snow. He was uninjured and they were able to return to the parking lot on their own.",

Neither ski areas are open yet and have yet to conduct any avalanche control within their boundaries. We interviewed the victim's ski partner. To say he was shaken up is an understatement. \n\nWhile neither had any rescue gear or formal avalanche training, they were both expert skiers and knew the terrain well. They had not consulted the avalanche advisory that morning in which the danger was rated Considerable to High. They continued to Snowbird via Baldy and accessed the Peruvian Cirque to gain the Gad Valley. While ascending out of the Peruvian Cirque they remotely triggered a large avalanche that covered their tracks that they had just made. It's unclear whether they realized they had triggered this large avalanche. They gained the ridge and prepared to drop into Gad Valley.\n\nWith the partner watching, the victim dropped into the slope, immediately triggering the slide. He was carried approximately 800 feet through steep rocky terrain and reportedly went over a small cliff band and came to a stop only partially buried. The partner went down to help the victim and called for a rescue, alerting both the Snowbird Ski Patrol and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, who subsequently accessed and evacuated the victim. ",

You always hear people say, that will never happen to me. Unfortunately, you never know. It’s a risk we take every day in the backcountry.\n\n \n\nWe were extremely lucky today. We happened to be in the wrong place. A slide was triggered and one of our friends was caught and carried. He fought to stay on top of the snow headed downhill head first. His sled was stopped by a big pine tree and buried pretty deep. He got separated from his sled and continued down to the next tree. This is where Curtis found him within a minute or so. His hand was out of the snow. Curtis started digging to clear his airways. Justin was talking, while Curtis worked to get him the rest of the way out. His adrenaline kicked in and was going as soon as Curtis got him out.\n\n\nDid we make mistakes today? Maybe. But we also did everything we have been trained to do. We checked the UAC forecast, we had our gear and used our training to make it home safe.\n\n ",

The east facing slope south of Saint Charles Peak is committing because there is no good way to ride out the bottom, so you have to come back up the hill in order to exit the drainage. The party played around on adjacent slopes and two had successfully climbed back out of the 36 degree slope a few times. \n\nThe slope had several tracks in it at the time of the avalanche. One rider climbed to the saddle on the top and watched, and a second was at the bottom also watching as the third attempted the climb. On the second attempt, the 47-year-old rider's sled did not have quite enough power to make the climb, and he turned near the top of the slope. The snow on the slope fractured even as the rider guided his sled in a rightward arc back down the hill. \n\nThe avalanche caught rider and sled near the south flank and a large rock held up the sled for a bit while the rider was carried (he mentioned using swimming motions) to near the toe at the bottom of the avalanche, ending up about 150' below his sled, face-down and partially buried in the debris. The fourth rider was below on the slope and heading up when the slope fractured. He decided to keep his sled pointed up the hill and rode on top of the slab, the throttle pegged, track spinning like a treadmill as the slab ran underneath, leaving him safely on the bed surface. \n\nThe other riders were able to get down to the lucky survivor and had him out of a face-down partial burial quite quickly. He was quickly spotted by his companions, and they had him out of the debris in \"really only a couple minutes.\" Thankfully, now He is mainly only shaken, and recovering from minor injuries. The sled was damaged in the avalanche, but the party repaired it in the field the next day and rode it out of the hole. \n\n ",

The slide was triggered at the steep break over at the top of the rib, and the portion that the skier was caught in was about 60' wide and 2 feet deep. However, the slide was able to propagate to skiers left, into part of an adjacent gully, where it was closer to 90 feet wide, and entrained much more snow.

One skier caught, carried and appeared to dislocate both shoulders.\nUDOT will look at the slide and we will post what they find.\nHere is a post on the TGR forum by the victim, which I reprint with permission after talking to him on the phone today.\nskibum is most likely referring to me... skied supe with telethor, tt's cousin and whapworth this morning, what an amazing run that is. great snow, noticed some debris in the usual spots but nothing too scary. left those guys at the bottom to go ski the bird with a buddy, and had a great day there too. about 2-3pm, i decided to ski out to white pine with a couple guys, one happened to be a coach for the SB freeski team and longtime ripper so i was confident following his lead, especially after our amazing run down sketchier SE superior. we skied to the very top of scotty's, scoped a little, and he dropped first, noticing sloughing but nothing much. since it was N facing and i was thinking it had been pretty cold with inconsistent sun all day, wet slabs were the last thing in my mind, and breaking off a deep slab was also not really something i was worried about. i dropped second in our party of three. made 2-3 turns on the spine i dropped on, and then got the feeling something wasn't right. figured some slough was chasing me, tried to stay high on the shoulder, but a BIG slab had ripped out above and around me. the rest is a blur, but i got taken in the 500-1000 foot range down the slope, maybe 2-300 vert. couldn't get my avalung in, as i think my shoulders had already popped from swimming when i went for it, my head went under a few times, and i came very close to numerous large trees. ended up in the open area underneath, with a bit of snow over my legs (whice were above my head), but head and most of body up. both skis/poles were apparently gone (partner found 2 skis 1 pole), and my shoulders were both completely dislocated, but i was up and OK. later on in the clinic (I somehow managed to avoid a chopper ride and skied the final ~1500 vert out, hunched over and in some serious pain) i heard it was 3-4 feet at the crown, and 200 feet wide. no idea how deep the debris was, though it didn't seem very deep where i ended up, but with the amount of snow that came down i am sure it could have buried me (my partner was luckily around 100 feet away from my resting place). it was by far the scariest moment of my entire life, and by sheer luck, and maybe a bit of help from the swimming, i made it, but it could have very easily turned out differently had i smashed one of the large trees or ended up in a different spot in the debris. i don't know if it was stupidity in not recognizing the significant warming from morning to afternoon, or an anomaly that i happened to strike in just the right place, but regardless i am thankful to be alive and happy no one else was involved. i plan on calling the UAC tomorrow and giving them my full account of what happened (i got home from the OR, where they had to completely get me under to get my L shoulder back in, around midnight tonight), and am very interested to read the full report. i learned a sobering lesson the hard way, but am lucky to live to ski another day, though i have a feeling it is going to take awhile for me to feel comfortable beyond the boundaries again. be careful out there guys, i am surprised and grateful that after my ride on a day when people were getting after much bigger stuff then scotty's, no one else was apparently injured or worse.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "Two skiers, a 50 year old male (Tyson Bradley) working as lead guide and a 49 year old client (Douglas Green), were backcountry skiing in the Mill A drainage of Big Cottonwood Canyon. They were part of a group of 8 containing 3 guides and 5 clients who ascended Gobbler's ridge via Baker pass. They observed a size 2.5 (destructive scale) natural avalanche from the previous day on an east facing slope on Mt. Raymond but no cracking, collapsing or other signs of instability on the day of the accident.\n\nBradley and one client descended a south facing avalanche path west of and adjacent to the path of the fatal avalanche. After this run the client left the area because he had a meeting in town at 12:30 p.m. They skied the slope without incident while the rest of the group skied a north westerly facing, treed slope known as the “Benign Line.”\n\nAfter the first run Bradley re-ascended the ridge and approached the top of the run called Whitesnake. He was joined by three others, one of whom was Douglas Green, and an apprentice guide. The third guide and one other client skied the “Benign Line” again.\n\nBradley dropped into the Whitesnake path, made a few ski cuts, and stopped 300' downhill at an island of safety on skier’s right about a foot above and to the side of where the avalanche released (see photo). He directed Green to ski to him. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run. After regrouping, Bradley began skiing again and directed Green to remain where they had stopped. While skiing the next section, the guide felt the slope collapse (which is the weak layer failing just before the avalanche releases). At the same time he noticed Green had started skiing as well. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run.\n\nBradley was caught in the avalanche but continued moving right. He impacted a tree and was pushed upward by the avalanche but not carried downhill. He was partially buried and sustained minor injuries. Green was carried downhill and fully buried. He inflated his avalanche air-bag backpack at some point during the avalanche.\n\nAfter extricating himself from avalanche debris, Bradley skied down the scoured avalanche path and around an exposed rock band where he triggered a small avalanche. He started a beacon search at the edge of the avalanche debris. After covering several hundred yards of debris, he acquired the Green’s signal. His beacon indicated a distance of 77 meters. At the burial location the smallest distance displayed by his beacon was 0.9 meters. He pinpointed Green’s exact location with an avalanche probe.\n\nGreen was fully buried on his side with his head approximately 3 feet deep and his body approximately 4-5 feet. His avalanche airbag was inflated. Maximum debris depth was 15 feet. Bradley dug him out of the debris and began CPR. He could not find a pulse. The apprentice guide and two other skiers arrived about a minute after Bradley began digging. They assisted in the exhausting work of digging Green out of the debris. The avalanche was reported at 14:30 to Alta Central Dispatch by the third guide. A medical helicopter landed and evacuated both the Bradley and Green to a hospital in Salt Lake City where Green was pronounced deceased.\n\nThe enormous debris pile snapped aspen trees and covered the terrain trap gully below the avalanche path for hundreds of yards. There was no stauchwall or lower boundary of the avalanche because the slab covering the entire slope released, creating an enormous amount of avalanche debris. The avalanche - estimated at 1-2' deep and 600' wide, pulled down every bit of snow between the starting zone near the ridge at 10,000' and well into the gulley at 9000'. The alpha angle, the angle from the toe of the debris to the crown, was 22 degrees.\n\nThe Utah Avalanche Center rated the avalanche danger in this terrain as Considerable and had issued an Avalanche Warning on January 21, 2016. See danger rose and bottom line below from that day’s advisory.\n\n\n\n“There [are] many weak layers and issues that will cause avalanches today. All the red flags are present. Widespread recent avalanche activity both natural and human triggered, recent snow and strong winds, widespread faceted layers in the snowpack, and today will have strong sunshine and temperatures possibly going above freezing. All these factors combine to make very dangerous avalanche conditions and a HIGH avalanche danger.”\n\nThe full advisory from that day can be found at:\n\nhttps://utahavalanchecenter.org/advisory/salt-lake/01/21/2016\n\n ",

Slope angles across the crown were not measured as conditions remained too hazardous to access the fracture line, though the starting zone is estimated at 35-37 degrees.

November’s snow was followed by a long, dry spell with only small, intermittent snow storms through early December. Periodic cold temperatures and clear skies faceted the shallow snowpack on shady slopes during this time. A series of storms between December 12th and 25th added several feet of snow to the snow pack and led to a major avalanche cycle.\n\nWeather events became even more complex in January. The New Year was ushered in with a strong southeasterly wind event that scoured and loaded unusual aspects, producing another avalanche cycle. This was followed by small, almost daily storms between January 3rd and 8th. A dry spell between January 9th and 13th, with warm sunny days and clear cold nights, developed near surface facets on shady slopes and created ice crusts on top of faceted snow on solar aspects.\n\nBetween January 14th and 20th, snow fell six out of seven days, culminating on January 20th with strong southwest to northwesterly winds, dense heavy snow and an active avalanche cycle. Snow totals from Big Cottonwood and the Park City side ranged from 7” to 11\" on the 20th, with storm water equivalents of .65\" to 1.04\". The Mill D North SNOTEL site had similar SWE numbers.\n\nJanuary 21st had sunny skies and temperatures ranging from near 10 degrees F into the low 20s.",

More details may be added later if it is possible to interview the survivor.\n\nThe accident occurred in Dutch Draw, a backcountry area south of the Canyons Resort.\n\nTimothy and his partner were on snowboards. They left through the well marked boundary gate at the top of 9990 Lift and traversed south It is believed both the victim and his partner descended about 150 or 200’ below the ridgeline and stopped near the cliffs. Then Timothy descended the next section first, triggered a slab avalanche. He was caught, carried and buried. Neither he nor his partner were wearing a beacon or had rescue gear.\n\nRescue: Timothy’s partner immediately headed down to the debris and started searching. As other backcountry travelers in adjacent area came into view, he called out for help, and a total of 8 people arrived. One was sent for help. The other 7 people searched the debris. None of the parties were equipped with beacons or rescue gear. Some skiers popped the baskets off their poles and probed. One struck the victim’s snowboard and they started digging just as 2 Canyons ski patrollers arrived on the scene. Timothy was dug out, and a ski patroller and Timothy’s partner started CPR. They transported the victim to a nearby flat area where a medical helicopter could land and transport the victim to the hospital. The victim was buried about 40 minutes. It is unknown if he died from trauma or asphyxiation.\n\nThe victim was carried about 600 vertical feet, strained through small trees, and buried near the toe of the slide. He buried head first downhill, face down, with his head approximately 3 feet below the snow surface in debris that was about 6 to 8 feet deep. The snowboard was broken in half, but held together by some of the material. \n\n \n\nemail from Jay Torgersen, Flight Paramedic, AirMed\n\nI was on the AirMed team that responded to the Canyons and worked with their Patrol on the side-country accident/fatality yesterday. Our team was made up of Casey Thompson-RN, Troy Stanton-Pilot and myself. Just wanted to pass on to your investigation team what a fantastic job the Canyon’s Patrol did coordinating the initial rescue effort. It was a difficult and potentially dangerous situation that they handled extremely well. It was evident that safety was their number one priority, not just for their own personnel but for those of us called in to assist. They also had to consider the safety of bystanders and the victim’s party who were attempting a partner rescue. There were several variables to consider in the cost versus benefit analysis faced by those running the incident. Having experienced and organized incident commanders with well thought out strategic plans and back-ups allowed the operation to unfold without further incident or harm to all involved. Without addressing the victims own personal preparedness, I don’t think there was anything that could have been done that would have changed the ultimate outcome. The Canyon’s Patrol and the Summit County SO team should be commended for outstanding work performed in a stressful, challenging and extremely difficult environment. Take care and be safe! Cheers,",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "3 Skiers approached Mt Aire from Lambs Canyon, Wednesday morning January 25. They ascended a North-South running ridge on Mt Aire and experienced at least one collapse in low angle terrain during the approach. They skied an East aspect off the ridge and did not report any collapsing or cracking. They switched to the West side of the ridge on a slope with a NW aspect. Skier 1 descended and continued to the trailhead. Skier 2 triggered the slide, but skier 1 did not know this. Skier 2 was caught and carried approximately 75 feet downhill to some trees but was not buried and not injured. Skier 3 descended to perform a rescue.\n\nSkier 2 was ok. Because they did not see skier 1, they assumed he was buried. They performed a beacon search but did not receive a signal. They reported that Skier 1 had been having some sort of trouble with his beacon this year; therefore, they assumed he was buried but his beacon was not working. At that point, they called 911 to get help. With no beacon signal, Skier's 2 & 3 and began probing areas with a high probability of burial (like the uphill side of trees). They scoured every inch of debris continuing to probe all likely areas. As they worked closer to the toe of the debris, they spotted skier 1's ski tracks which were not obvious. They followed his tracks to the trail head and discovered he was ok. While skiing back to the trail head, another avalanche was triggered on buried surface hoar.\n\nWe at the UAC are all very happy no one was injured or killed. We are also very appreciative that members of the party were very open and willing to talk about this incident so that the rest of us can learn and be safer. Avalanches are stressful and confusing events. What is important in this scenario is that they exposed only one person at a time to the avalanche terrain. Despite the confusion, only one person was caught. Skier 2 was lucky to have avoided trauma. Even small avalanches moving slowly can cause serious trauma. Running into a tree a 20 mph (which is slow for an avalanche) can hurt.",

Surface hoar just like frost on a car windshield except it is very fragile and can easily be destroyed by wind or sunshine. Winds began to increase on Wednesday night (1/18) and into Thursday morning (1/19), before diminishing midday on Thursday. At the Reynolds Peak wind station at 9400 ft, winds blew generally from the S and SSW 10-15 mph with only slightly stronger gusts. A the Parleys Summit weather station at 7000 ft, the strongest winds blew 10 mph gusting to 15 mph from a generally westerly direction. In contrast, winds at 11,000 ft in Little Cottonwood Canyon briefly blew 30 mph gusting to 50 mph from the S.\n\nA weak storm system deposited 3-5\" in the Salt Lake mountains on Thursday. This snow capped and preserved this surface hoar layer on sheltered slopes where it wasn't destroyed by the wind. Snowfall since Thursday contained 1.8 inches of water at the Parleys Summit SNOTEL site at 7500 ft just north of Summit Park and I-80. Snowfall since Thursday contained 2.08 inches of water at the Spruces weather station at 7400 ft in Big Cottonwood Canyon. On the day of the accident, we found 18-26 inches of snow on top of the surface hoar layer which corresponds well to these water numbers.",

At that point, a wet loose slide cascaded down upon them from above, pummeling the second who was on rappel while catching and carrying the first over two minor cliffbands. It is not known whether the person on rappel was clipped into the anchor or backed up with an autoblock above or below his rappel device. It is also not known whether the loose sluff was a natural or triggered from above. \n\nAfter the avalanche, both were able to make it down to the road unassisted. \n\nPhotos courtesy Stacee at Powderbird",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "I was skiing alone, coming back into Little Cottonwood Canyon from Cardiac Bowl after a long and very enjoyable morning of skiing mostly north and some east facing classic Wasatch powder. I gained the ridgeline at the Little Superior Buttress, and decided to make my descent from just above it. As I removed my skins up on the ridge, I examined the slope below. The initial portion of the run dropped about 100 feet south east facing before opening up into a broader bowl above a rock band. My intention was to make my way skiers left over to the frequently skied fin that drops from just below the buttress.\n As I gained the more south facing open bowl above the rock band, I noticed a large number of roller balls and debris coming down from above. The next thing I knew, I was in the middle of a large wet slab avalanche. I suppose the release knocked me down, but at first it seemed like the slab was moving slowly. it started gaining speed as it carried me towards a funnel through the rock band. Unfortunately I was on my back with my legs and skis above me. I was unable to move to right myself and I realized I was going over the rock band, headfirst. The snow was so dense that I easily floated on top. It was like riding a 2 foot thick churning carpet of roller balls and slush. I believe it protected me from the rocks as I went backwards over the probably 20' rock band.\nIt certainly cushioned the blow as I came down on the slope below. Once over the rock band, the slide continued to gain speed. I had only one ski and one pole still with me, but I managed to get an edge into the sliding snow. I fought hard with the remaining pole and my free arm to get off of the slide to skier's left, just before it poured over the choke of a second and slightly taller rock band. For what seemed like a really long time, more than a minute for sure, the wet slide just kept pouring down from above and through the choke.\nWith the slide over, I waited for the adrenaline rush to subside somewhat and determined that I didn't have any serious injuries. I dialed 911 to alert Alta Central about the slide and that nobody had been buried in it. As I down climbed the rock band, kicking toeholds into the remaining snow, I punched through a few places to reveal a virtual waterfall- 3-4\" of running water below the snow surface.\nAnother 200 feet or so below, the slide had come to a stop in a broad tongue of debris 2-3 feet deep. My lost pole and ski were easily retrieved from their final resting places atop the debris pile. Making my way down to them, the bed surface was a moistened, but still bulletproof sun crust- completely scoured of the weekend's new snow. It wasn't until the low angle apron just above the road that I ever noted the snow surface to be getting damp and manky.\n\nForecaster Note: It's unknown if this was a wet loose sluff, or perhaps a slab. So we've classified it as a Storm Snow slide.",

We skied one run and on the second run the first skier dropped in and made 4 turns and just beyond the crest a 2- 2 1/2 foot fracture 80-100 feet wide broke loose. He rode it down almost buried (only head visable) and it came to a stop 100-120 yards down. He was buried up to waist and was able to dig out on own. \nOvercast, foggy, no wind around 30 degrees.\n\nSnow was medium weight powder on top 2 feet and the slope angle was around 35-40 degree where the fracture occured. The debre at the bottom of slide was 3-4 feet deep. \nThe slide let loose slowly--did no hear anything.\nNone\nNo new snow and it did not appear to be much wind loading.\nI would pass by this line in the future.\n\nYour Avalanche forcast for the day describes very much what happend in this incident. I can send photos later if you would like. Also the slide is visible from the top of the Milli lift.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "With permission and from Mark White's Blog : \"Today we headed up Butler Fork thinking that we would stay out of the wind and ski a sheltered NE facing bowl at around 9,000ft. We realized the snow was denser than expected and slightly inverted on our hike in but we stayed out of the wind and never felt any slabby snow. This bowl is steep at the top, 38 plus degrees, then mellows out rapidly in the middle. We ascended in the steep trees on skiers right side, did a ski cut that only produced sluffing and skied the bowl with no obvious instabilities. We proceeded to hike up again but this time went up about 10 feet higher, still on the edge of the trees. My partner was about 10 feet in front of me and stomped out a flat spot to take his skins off, next thing we know the bowl is fracturing 50ft above us. My partner was on the edge of the slide and just got pushed 2 feet. I was in the middle, got pushed into a stand of trees and got buried to the top of my chest. I also heard and felt my hamstring pop. I was still in hiking mode with toes locked in and skins on with my legs all twisted up. It required my partner to dig me out and release my skis from my feet. A few minutes after I was out we heard a pop and the middle of the bowl pulled out remotely. The first slide was 100ft wide, 18 inches at the deepest point. The next slide extended the crown to 250ft and ran to where the slope flattened out. I doubt we would’ve triggered a slide if we would have stayed lower out of the windslab. The windslab wasn’t obvious but it only makes sense in retrospect. There’s a massive cornice at the top and while the wind wasn’t out of hand it was still loading the slope right below the cornice with denser snow. Sometimes the line between triggering a slide and not is thin but it sucks to be on the wrong side of that line. Just glad I had a good partner with me and can ski on one leg fairly efficiently. Mistakes were definitely made but we live and hopefully learn from them.\"\n\n \n\n ",

The avalanche propagated about 300 feet above them. One skier was able to grab a tree and avoid taking the ride which the other skier did. He took about a 300 foot ride and was strained through some aspens and completely buried near the toe. His partner who did not go for a ride located him with an avalanche transceiver and dug him out from under about 4 feet of snow. He was uninjured and they were able to return to the parking lot on their own.",

Another point of interest is that he was wearing a avalanche air bag and did not deploy it, not sure if he was getting trundled too hard to pull the cord or what happened, hopefully he will send in a report and give us some first hand information. in a report",

Neither ski areas are open yet and have yet to conduct any avalanche control within their boundaries. We interviewed the victim's ski partner. To say he was shaken up is an understatement. \n\nWhile neither had any rescue gear or formal avalanche training, they were both expert skiers and knew the terrain well. They had not consulted the avalanche advisory that morning in which the danger was rated Considerable to High. They continued to Snowbird via Baldy and accessed the Peruvian Cirque to gain the Gad Valley. While ascending out of the Peruvian Cirque they remotely triggered a large avalanche that covered their tracks that they had just made. It's unclear whether they realized they had triggered this large avalanche. They gained the ridge and prepared to drop into Gad Valley.\n\nWith the partner watching, the victim dropped into the slope, immediately triggering the slide. He was carried approximately 800 feet through steep rocky terrain and reportedly went over a small cliff band and came to a stop only partially buried. The partner went down to help the victim and called for a rescue, alerting both the Snowbird Ski Patrol and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, who subsequently accessed and evacuated the victim. ",

You always hear people say, that will never happen to me. Unfortunately, you never know. It’s a risk we take every day in the backcountry.\n\n \n\nWe were extremely lucky today. We happened to be in the wrong place. A slide was triggered and one of our friends was caught and carried. He fought to stay on top of the snow headed downhill head first. His sled was stopped by a big pine tree and buried pretty deep. He got separated from his sled and continued down to the next tree. This is where Curtis found him within a minute or so. His hand was out of the snow. Curtis started digging to clear his airways. Justin was talking, while Curtis worked to get him the rest of the way out. His adrenaline kicked in and was going as soon as Curtis got him out.\n\n\nDid we make mistakes today? Maybe. But we also did everything we have been trained to do. We checked the UAC forecast, we had our gear and used our training to make it home safe.\n\n ",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "When a party of four riders entered the bowl from the top it was completely untracked and nice smooth powder. The east facing slope south of Saint Charles Peak is committing because there is no good way to ride out the bottom, so you have to come back up the hill in order to exit the drainage. The party played around on adjacent slopes and two had successfully climbed back out of the 36 degree slope a few times. \n\nThe slope had several tracks in it at the time of the avalanche. One rider climbed to the saddle on the top and watched, and a second was at the bottom also watching as the third attempted the climb. On the second attempt, the 47-year-old rider's sled did not have quite enough power to make the climb, and he turned near the top of the slope. The snow on the slope fractured even as the rider guided his sled in a rightward arc back down the hill. \n\nThe avalanche caught rider and sled near the south flank and a large rock held up the sled for a bit while the rider was carried (he mentioned using swimming motions) to near the toe at the bottom of the avalanche, ending up about 150' below his sled, face-down and partially buried in the debris. The fourth rider was below on the slope and heading up when the slope fractured. He decided to keep his sled pointed up the hill and rode on top of the slab, the throttle pegged, track spinning like a treadmill as the slab ran underneath, leaving him safely on the bed surface. \n\nThe other riders were able to get down to the lucky survivor and had him out of a face-down partial burial quite quickly. He was quickly spotted by his companions, and they had him out of the debris in \"really only a couple minutes.\" Thankfully, now He is mainly only shaken, and recovering from minor injuries. The sled was damaged in the avalanche, but the party repaired it in the field the next day and rode it out of the hole. \n\n ",

The rescue ended up going on well into the night, and involved about 50 rescuers from Cache, Franklin, and Bear Lake Counties. Read Report\n\nThe same slope was the site of a tragic fatality on February 19, 2000. Read Report \n\nThe avalanche occurred on a mostly east facing slope and started at around 9200' in elevation. The toe of the avalanche was at around 8700'. The slope measures only about 36 degrees in steepness in the steepest area, and I measured the Alpha angle of this avalanche at 25 degrees.",

The slide was triggered at the steep break over at the top of the rib, and the portion that the skier was caught in was about 60' wide and 2 feet deep. However, the slide was able to propagate to skiers left, into part of an adjacent gully, where it was closer to 90 feet wide, and entrained much more snow.

The two companions quickly got to the victim and quickly revived the victim. According to a second-hand account, the skier tried to grab a tree (see the photo of the glove attached to the tree) and was able to do so for a few seconds before being carried. This may have helped save them from being carried more deeply into the debris. The crown of the avalanche was 12-24\" deep and the avalanche propagated widely - over 600' and across two other drainages. This was a very large and dangerous avalanche with a fortunate outcome.\n\n ",

One skier caught, carried and appeared to dislocate both shoulders.\nUDOT will look at the slide and we will post what they find.\nHere is a post on the TGR forum by the victim, which I reprint with permission after talking to him on the phone today.\nskibum is most likely referring to me... skied supe with telethor, tt's cousin and whapworth this morning, what an amazing run that is. great snow, noticed some debris in the usual spots but nothing too scary. left those guys at the bottom to go ski the bird with a buddy, and had a great day there too. about 2-3pm, i decided to ski out to white pine with a couple guys, one happened to be a coach for the SB freeski team and longtime ripper so i was confident following his lead, especially after our amazing run down sketchier SE superior. we skied to the very top of scotty's, scoped a little, and he dropped first, noticing sloughing but nothing much. since it was N facing and i was thinking it had been pretty cold with inconsistent sun all day, wet slabs were the last thing in my mind, and breaking off a deep slab was also not really something i was worried about. i dropped second in our party of three. made 2-3 turns on the spine i dropped on, and then got the feeling something wasn't right. figured some slough was chasing me, tried to stay high on the shoulder, but a BIG slab had ripped out above and around me. the rest is a blur, but i got taken in the 500-1000 foot range down the slope, maybe 2-300 vert. couldn't get my avalung in, as i think my shoulders had already popped from swimming when i went for it, my head went under a few times, and i came very close to numerous large trees. ended up in the open area underneath, with a bit of snow over my legs (whice were above my head), but head and most of body up. both skis/poles were apparently gone (partner found 2 skis 1 pole), and my shoulders were both completely dislocated, but i was up and OK. later on in the clinic (I somehow managed to avoid a chopper ride and skied the final ~1500 vert out, hunched over and in some serious pain) i heard it was 3-4 feet at the crown, and 200 feet wide. no idea how deep the debris was, though it didn't seem very deep where i ended up, but with the amount of snow that came down i am sure it could have buried me (my partner was luckily around 100 feet away from my resting place). it was by far the scariest moment of my entire life, and by sheer luck, and maybe a bit of help from the swimming, i made it, but it could have very easily turned out differently had i smashed one of the large trees or ended up in a different spot in the debris. i don't know if it was stupidity in not recognizing the significant warming from morning to afternoon, or an anomaly that i happened to strike in just the right place, but regardless i am thankful to be alive and happy no one else was involved. i plan on calling the UAC tomorrow and giving them my full account of what happened (i got home from the OR, where they had to completely get me under to get my L shoulder back in, around midnight tonight), and am very interested to read the full report. i learned a sobering lesson the hard way, but am lucky to live to ski another day, though i have a feeling it is going to take awhile for me to feel comfortable beyond the boundaries again. be careful out there guys, i am surprised and grateful that after my ride on a day when people were getting after much bigger stuff then scotty's, no one else was apparently injured or worse.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "Two skiers, a 50 year old male (Tyson Bradley) working as lead guide and a 49 year old client (Douglas Green), were backcountry skiing in the Mill A drainage of Big Cottonwood Canyon. They were part of a group of 8 containing 3 guides and 5 clients who ascended Gobbler's ridge via Baker pass. They observed a size 2.5 (destructive scale) natural avalanche from the previous day on an east facing slope on Mt. Raymond but no cracking, collapsing or other signs of instability on the day of the accident.\n\nBradley and one client descended a south facing avalanche path west of and adjacent to the path of the fatal avalanche. After this run the client left the area because he had a meeting in town at 12:30 p.m. They skied the slope without incident while the rest of the group skied a north westerly facing, treed slope known as the “Benign Line.”\n\nAfter the first run Bradley re-ascended the ridge and approached the top of the run called Whitesnake. He was joined by three others, one of whom was Douglas Green, and an apprentice guide. The third guide and one other client skied the “Benign Line” again.\n\nBradley dropped into the Whitesnake path, made a few ski cuts, and stopped 300' downhill at an island of safety on skier’s right about a foot above and to the side of where the avalanche released (see photo). He directed Green to ski to him. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run. After regrouping, Bradley began skiing again and directed Green to remain where they had stopped. While skiing the next section, the guide felt the slope collapse (which is the weak layer failing just before the avalanche releases). At the same time he noticed Green had started skiing as well. The apprentice guide and the other two clients remained at the top of the run.\n\nBradley was caught in the avalanche but continued moving right. He impacted a tree and was pushed upward by the avalanche but not carried downhill. He was partially buried and sustained minor injuries. Green was carried downhill and fully buried. He inflated his avalanche air-bag backpack at some point during the avalanche.\n\nAfter extricating himself from avalanche debris, Bradley skied down the scoured avalanche path and around an exposed rock band where he triggered a small avalanche. He started a beacon search at the edge of the avalanche debris. After covering several hundred yards of debris, he acquired the Green’s signal. His beacon indicated a distance of 77 meters. At the burial location the smallest distance displayed by his beacon was 0.9 meters. He pinpointed Green’s exact location with an avalanche probe.\n\nGreen was fully buried on his side with his head approximately 3 feet deep and his body approximately 4-5 feet. His avalanche airbag was inflated. Maximum debris depth was 15 feet. Bradley dug him out of the debris and began CPR. He could not find a pulse. The apprentice guide and two other skiers arrived about a minute after Bradley began digging. They assisted in the exhausting work of digging Green out of the debris. The avalanche was reported at 14:30 to Alta Central Dispatch by the third guide. A medical helicopter landed and evacuated both the Bradley and Green to a hospital in Salt Lake City where Green was pronounced deceased.\n\nThe enormous debris pile snapped aspen trees and covered the terrain trap gully below the avalanche path for hundreds of yards. There was no stauchwall or lower boundary of the avalanche because the slab covering the entire slope released, creating an enormous amount of avalanche debris. The avalanche - estimated at 1-2' deep and 600' wide, pulled down every bit of snow between the starting zone near the ridge at 10,000' and well into the gulley at 9000'. The alpha angle, the angle from the toe of the debris to the crown, was 22 degrees.\n\nThe Utah Avalanche Center rated the avalanche danger in this terrain as Considerable and had issued an Avalanche Warning on January 21, 2016. See danger rose and bottom line below from that day’s advisory.\n\n\n\n“There [are] many weak layers and issues that will cause avalanches today. All the red flags are present. Widespread recent avalanche activity both natural and human triggered, recent snow and strong winds, widespread faceted layers in the snowpack, and today will have strong sunshine and temperatures possibly going above freezing. All these factors combine to make very dangerous avalanche conditions and a HIGH avalanche danger.”\n\nThe full advisory from that day can be found at:\n\nhttps://utahavalanchecenter.org/advisory/salt-lake/01/21/2016\n\n ",

The starting zone aspects ran from 107 degrees ESE to 215 degrees SSW. The upper starting zone was cross-loaded from strong west to northwest winds in the late evening of January 19 into January 20. Slope angles across the crown were not measured as conditions remained too hazardous to access the fracture line, though the starting zone is estimated at 35-37 degrees. Two adjacent slopes avalanched naturally several days later on January 24 and January 27.",

        "Weather Conditions and History": "The weather has been complex this winter. November’s snow was followed by a long, dry spell with only small, intermittent snow storms through early December. Periodic cold temperatures and clear skies faceted the shallow snowpack on shady slopes during this time. A series of storms between December 12th and 25th added several feet of snow to the snow pack and led to a major avalanche cycle.\n\nWeather events became even more complex in January. The New Year was ushered in with a strong southeasterly wind event that scoured and loaded unusual aspects, producing another avalanche cycle. This was followed by small, almost daily storms between January 3rd and 8th. A dry spell between January 9th and 13th, with warm sunny days and clear cold nights, developed near surface facets on shady slopes and created ice crusts on top of faceted snow on solar aspects.\n\nBetween January 14th and 20th, snow fell six out of seven days, culminating on January 20th with strong southwest to northwesterly winds, dense heavy snow and an active avalanche cycle. Snow totals from Big Cottonwood and the Park City side ranged from 7” to 11\" on the 20th, with storm water equivalents of .65\" to 1.04\". The Mill D North SNOTEL site had similar SWE numbers.\n\nJanuary 21st had sunny skies and temperatures ranging from near 10 degrees F into the low 20s.",

        "Accident and Rescue Summary": "Timothy Robert Baker, 24, died in an avalanche he triggered under the cliffs in Dutch Draw n February 23, 2012.\nThis is information is from talking with the Canyons ski patrollers who responded to the accident and a visit to the site by UAC forecasters Evelyn Lees and Brett Kobernik. More details may be added later if it is possible to interview the survivor.\n\nThe accident occurred in Dutch Draw, a backcountry area south of the Canyons Resort.\n\nTimothy and his partner were on snowboards. They left through the well marked boundary gate at the top of 9990 Lift and traversed south It is believed both the victim and his partner descended about 150 or 200’ below the ridgeline and stopped near the cliffs. Then Timothy descended the next section first, triggered a slab avalanche. He was caught, carried and buried. Neither he nor his partner were wearing a beacon or had rescue gear.\n\nRescue: Timothy’s partner immediately headed down to the debris and started searching. As other backcountry travelers in adjacent area came into view, he called out for help, and a total of 8 people arrived. One was sent for help. The other 7 people searched the debris. None of the parties were equipped with beacons or rescue gear. Some skiers popped the baskets off their poles and probed. One struck the victim’s snowboard and they started digging just as 2 Canyons ski patrollers arrived on the scene. Timothy was dug out, and a ski patroller and Timothy’s partner started CPR. They transported the victim to a nearby flat area where a medical helicopter could land and transport the victim to the hospital. The victim was buried about 40 minutes. It is unknown if he died from trauma or asphyxiation.\n\nThe victim was carried about 600 vertical feet, strained through small trees, and buried near the toe of the slide. He buried head first downhill, face down, with his head approximately 3 feet below the snow surface in debris that was about 6 to 8 feet deep. The snowboard was broken in half, but held together by some of the material. \n\n \n\nemail from Jay Torgersen, Flight Paramedic, AirMed\n\nI was on the AirMed team that responded to the Canyons and worked with their Patrol on the side-country accident/fatality yesterday. Our team was made up of Casey Thompson-RN, Troy Stanton-Pilot and myself. Just wanted to pass on to your investigation team what a fantastic job the Canyon’s Patrol did coordinating the initial rescue effort. It was a difficult and potentially dangerous situation that they handled extremely well. It was evident that safety was their number one priority, not just for their own personnel but for those of us called in to assist. They also had to consider the safety of bystanders and the victim’s party who were attempting a partner rescue. There were several variables to consider in the cost versus benefit analysis faced by those running the incident. Having experienced and organized incident commanders with well thought out strategic plans and back-ups allowed the operation to unfold without further incident or harm to all involved. Without addressing the victims own personal preparedness, I don’t think there was anything that could have been done that would have changed the ultimate outcome. The Canyon’s Patrol and the Summit County SO team should be commended for outstanding work performed in a stressful, challenging and extremely difficult environment. Take care and be safe! Cheers,",
